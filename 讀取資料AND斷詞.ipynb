business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' Any economic downturn deepening of an economic downturn continued deficit spending by the Federal Government or state budget pressures may result in a reduction in payments and covered services', ' Adverse developments in the United States could lead to a reduction in Federal Government expenditures including governmentally funded programs in which we participate such as Medicare and Medicaid', ' In addition if at any time the Federal Government is not able to meet its debt payments unless the federal debt

Medicare home health and hospice payments of 2% beginning April 1 2013 sequestration - suspended from May 1 2020 through March 31 2022; reinstated at 1% for the period April 1 2022 through June 30 2022 and at 2% thereafter', ' Historically state budget pressures have resulted in reductions in state spending', ' Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services', ' In addition sustained unfavorable economic conditions may affect the number of patients enrolled in managed care programs and the profitability of managed care companies which could result in reduced payment rates and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition

to maintain our current payor or revenue mix', ' We are continuing our efforts to develop our non-Medicare sources of revenue', ' Any changes in payment levels from current or future third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', 'Our business may be materially adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic', ' The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a general economic downturn and volatility in the stock market and has also caused and may continue to cause a decrease in our patient volumes and revenues an increase in our costs an inability to access our patients and referral sources staffing shortages and medical supply shortages any of which or a combination of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results', ' The ultimate impact of COVID-19 including the impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on many factors and future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time such as the severity scope and length of time that the pandemic continues including regional surges in COVID-19 cases at various times the impact of new variants of the virus uncertainty regarding vaccine utilization and efficacy in slowing the spread of the virus staffing shortages due to federal state and local vaccine mandates the impact of COVID-19 on the national and global economy the effect of COVID-19 on the demand for our services our ability to ensure the safety of our patients and employees and the actions taken by federal state and local authorities to contain or treat the COVID-19 pandemic', ' In addition the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread global supply chain disruptions to vendors including critical supply shortages significant material cost inflation and extended lead times for items that are required for our operations', ' Any such interruptions could increase our costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations', ' A shortage of qualified registered nursing staff and other clinicians such as therapists and nurse practitioners could materially impact our ability to attract train and retain qualified personnel and could increase operating costs', ' We compete for qualified personnel with other healthcare providers', ' Our ability to attract and retain clinicians depends on several factors including our ability to provide these personnel with attractive assignments and competitive salaries and benefits', ' We cannot be assured we will succeed in any of these areas', ' In addition there are shortages of qualified health care personnel in some of our markets', ' As a result we may face higher costs of attracting clinicians and providing them with attractive benefit packages than we originally anticipated or we may have to utilize contract clinicians both of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' In addition if we expand our operations into geographic areas where health care providers historically have been unionized or if any of our care center employees become unionized being subject to a collective bargaining agreement may have a negative impact on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel and may increase our operating costs', ' Generally if we are unable to attract and retain clinicians the quality of our services may decline and we could lose patients and referral sources which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' Because we are limited in our ability to control rates received for our services our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain or reduce our costs to provide such services', ' As Medicare is our primary payor and rates are established through federal legislation we have to manage our costs of providing care to achieve a desired level of profitability', ' Additionally non-Medicare rates are difficult for us to negotiate as such payors are under pressure to reduce their own costs', ' As a result we manage our costs in order to achieve a desired level of profitability including but not limited to centralization of various processes the use of technology and management of the number of employees utilized', ' If we are not able to continue to streamline our processes and reduce our costs our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected', ' If we are unable to provide consistently high quality of care our business will be adversely impacted', ' Providing quality patient care is the cornerstone of our business', ' We believe that hospitals physicians and other referral sources refer patients to us in large part because of our reputation for delivering quality care', ' Clinical quality is becoming increasingly important within our industry', ' Effective October 2012 Medicare began to impose a financial penalty upon hospitals that have excessive rates of patient readmissions within 30 days from hospital discharge', ' We believe this regulation provides a competitive advantage to home health providers who can differentiate themselves based upon quality particularly by achieving low patient acute care hospitalization readmission rates and by implementing disease management programs designed to be responsive to the needs of patients served by referring hospitals', ' We are focused intently upon improving our patient outcomes particularly our patient acute care hospitalization readmission rates', ' If we should fail to attain our goals regarding acute care hospitalization readmission rates and other quality metrics we expect our ability to generate referrals would be adversely impacted which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' Additionally Medicare has established consumer-facing websites Home Health Compare and Hospice Compare that present data regarding our performance on certain quality measures compared to state and national averages', ' Failure to achieve or exceed these averages may affect our ability to generate referrals which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' If we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected', 'Our success depends on referrals from physicians hospitals and other sources in the communities we serve and on our ability to maintain good relationships with existing referral sources', ' Our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers', ' Our growth and profitability depend in part on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of home health and hospice care by our referral sources and their patients', ' Our loss of or failure to maintain existing relationships or our failure to develop new referral relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' Possible changes in the case mix of patients as well as payor mix and payment methodologies could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' Our revenue is determined by a number of factors including our mix of patients and the rates of payment among payors', ' Changes in the case mix of our patients payment methodologies or the payor mix among Medicare Medicaid and private payors could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' Our failure to negotiate favorable managed care contracts or our loss of existing favorable managed care contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' One of our strategies is to diversify our payor sources by increasing the business we do with managed care companies', ' We strive to put in place favorable contracts with managed care payors; however we may not be successful in these efforts', ' Additionally there is a risk that the favorable managed care contracts that we put in place may be terminated', ' Managed care contracts typically permit the payor to terminate the contract without cause on very short notice typically 60 days which can provide payors leverage to reduce volume or obtain favorable pricing', ' Our failure to negotiate and put in place favorable managed care contracts or our failure to maintain in place favorable managed care contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' Our industry is highly competitive with few barriers to entry in certain states', ' There are few barriers to entry in home health and hospice markets that do not require a CON or POA', ' Our primary competition comes from local privately-owned publicly-owned and hospital-owned health care providers', ' We compete based on the availability of personnel the quality of services expertise of visiting staff and in certain instances on the price of our services', ' In addition we compete with a number of non-profit organizations that finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us', ' Increased competition in the future may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share', ' Further the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings by others in combination with industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors including mergers of competitors with each other and with insurers could cause a decline in revenue or loss of market acceptance of our services or make our services less attractive', ' Managed care organizations and other third party payors continue to consolidate which enhances their ability to influence the delivery of health care services', ' Consequently the health care needs of patients in the United States are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations', ' These organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers', ' Our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if these organizations terminate us as a provider andor engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider', ' In addition should private payors including managed care payors seek to negotiate additional discounted fee structures or the assumption by health care providers of all or a portion of the financial risk through prepaid capitation arrangements our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected', ' If we are unable to react competitively to new developments our operating results may suffer', ' State CON or POA laws often limit the ability of competitors to enter into a given market are not uniform throughout the United States and are frequently the subject of efforts to limit or repeal such laws', ' If states remove existing CONs or POAs we could face increased competition in these states', ' There can be no assurances that other states will not seek to eliminate or limit their existing CON or POA programs which could lead to increased competition in these states', ' Further we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', 'The success of our high acuity care segment depends on on our ability to enter into capitation and other forms of risk-based contracts with managed care health plans', ' If we are unsuccessful in obtaining these contracts or if we are unsuccessful in managing costs associated with risk-based contracts our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected', ' Our acquisition of Contessa not only established the foundation for our high acuity care segment but it also added key infrastructure to enable us to more quickly and effectively enter into risk-based contracts with managed care health plans', ' Should our high acuity care joint venture partnerships not deliver sufficient perceived value to managed care health plans those health plans may limit or forego opportunities to partner with us in expanded risk-based contracts', ' Additionally assuming risk from managed care health plans requires that the appropriate clinical and operating protocols be in place to actuarially assess eligible members and determine historical baseline healthcare expenditures enroll eligible members into the program effectuate a clinically effective plan of care to treat those patients primarily in a home-based setting and coordinate care throughout various phases of the members treatment including proactive primary care and palliative care services', ' Should we be ineffective in identifying and enrolling members into the program or should the clinical treatment plans we implement for enrolled members not result in reduced healthcare costs during the period in which those members are enrolled we could incur significant additional costs under these contracts that exceed the revenues we receive', ' These negative outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' Our business depends on our information systems', ' A cyber-attack security breach or our inability to effectively integrate manage and keep our information systems secure and operational could disrupt our operations', ' Most healthcare providers including all who accept commercial insurance Medicare and Medicaid must comply with the HIPAA regulations regarding the privacy and security of protected health information', ' All 50 states also maintain laws focused on the privacy security and notification requirements with regard to personal information including health information', ' The HIPAA regulations impose significant requirements on providers and our third party vendor business associates with regard to how such protected health information may be used and disclosed', ' Further the regulations include extensive and complex requirements for providers to establish reasonable and appropriate administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of protected health information', ' Providers are obligated under HIPAA and state law to notify individuals and the government if personal information is compromised as defined by the respective law', ' In addition to federal regulators state attorneys general are also enforcing information security breaches', ' All 50 states have breach notification laws', ' In addition to state laws regarding confidentiality of medical information several states are now focused on expanding state privacy laws regarding personal information', ' HIPAA directs the Secretary of HHS to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates as that term is defined under HIPAA comply with the applicable HIPAA requirements', ' Our networks systems and devices store sensitive information including intellectual property proprietary business information and personal information of our patients partners and employees', ' We have installed privacy protection systems and devices on our network systems and point of care tablets in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to information created received transmitted and maintained by us', ' However our technology may fail to adequately secure the protected health information and personal information we create receive transmit and maintain in our databases', ' In such circumstances we may be held liable to our patients and regulators which could result in fines litigation or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows', ' Even if we are not held liable any resulting negative publicity could harm our business and distract the attention of management', ' Our business depends on effective secure and operational information systems which include systems provided by or hosted by external contractors partners and other service providers', ' For example our care centers depend upon our information systems and software for patient care accounting billing collections risk management quality assurance human resources payroll and other information considered to be sensitive andor confidential', ' We believe that our subcontractors and vendors take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our business operations as a result of failure or disruption to their information systems or networks', ' However there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a system disruption or security incident', ' The occurrence of any information system failure or security incident at one of these third parties could result in interruptions delays breaches of protected health information and personal information loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of these systems and the information they create receive transmit or maintain', ' All of these events or circumstances among others could have an adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition results of operations and cash flows and they could harm our business reputation', ' In general all information systems including those we host or have hosted by third parties are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire flood power loss telecommunications failure human acts break-ins and other intentional or unintentional events', ' Our business is also at risk from and may be materially impacted andor disrupted by information security incidents such as ransomware malware viruses phishing social engineering and other security events', ' Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats', ' These events can also result from internal compromises such as human error or malicious acts and can occur on our systems or on the systems of our partners and subcontractors', ' Problems with or the failure of our technology and

unauthorized access to protected health information and personal information stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer viruses or other malicious software programs to our systems', ' Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations and reputation could be materially adversely affected by federal and state fines and penalties legal claims or proceedings cancellation of contracts and loss of patients if security breaches are not prevented', ' The healthcare industry is currently a target for cyber criminals and is therefore experiencing increased attention on compliance with regulations designed to safeguard protected health information and mitigate cyber-attacks on entities', ' There are significant costs associated with a breach including investigation costs remediation and mitigation costs notification costs attorney fees litigation and the potential for reputational harm and lost revenues due to a

direct and indirect payments or other financial arrangements between health care providers that are designed to encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider for medical services', ' In addition to these anti-kickback laws the Federal Government has enacted specific legislation the physician self-referral prohibition commonly known as the “Stark Law that prohibits certain financial relationships specifically including ownership interests and compensation arrangements between physicians and the immediate family members of physicians and providers of designated health services such as home health care centers to whom the physicians refer patients', ' Some of these same financial relationships are also subject to additional regulation by states', ' Although we believe we have structured our relationships with physicians and other actual or potential referral sources to comply with these laws where applicable the laws are complex', ' It is possible that courts or

Medicare businesses PPACA may also significantly affect our non-Medicare business', ' PPACA makes many changes to the underwriting and marketing practices of private payors', ' The resulting economic pressures could prompt these payors to seek to lower their rates of reimbursement for the services we provide', ' As a result PPACA may continue to have residual effects on our non-Medicare business', ' Finally efforts to repeal or substantially modify provisions of the PPACA continue in Congress and in the courts', ' The ultimate outcomes of legislative efforts to repeal substantially amend

review with a 25% payment reduction for all home health services', ' Reduced review options are available for home health agencies that demonstrate compliance', ' Compliance with this process could result in increased administrative costs or delays in reimbursement for home health services in states subject to the demonstration', ' Additionally our hospice operations may experience payment delays', ' We have experienced payment delays when attempting to collect funds from state Medicaid programs in certain instances', ' Delays in receiving payments from these programs may also materially adversely affect our working capital', ' Changes in units of payment for home health agencies could reduce our Medicare home health reimbursement levels', ' Effective January 1 2020 CMS implemented a revised case-mix adjustment methodology the Patient-Driven Groupings Model PDGM', ' Although this change was to be implemented in an overall budget neutral manner the ultimate impact varied by provider based on factors including patient mix and admission source', ' Additionally CMS made assumptions about behavioral changes which resulted in a 4.36% reduction to reimbursement', '

significant reduction in the enrollment in our health benefits programs or PBM products or services particularly in states where we have large regional concentrations could have an adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' A significant reduction in the number of enrollees in our health benefits programs or PBM products or services could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' Factors that could contribute to a reduction in enrollment include reductions in workforce by existing customers; a general economic upturn that results in fewer individuals being eligible for Medicaid programs; the end of the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification for Medicaid recipients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which will likely result in a reduction in our Medicaid membership; a general economic downturn that results in business failures and high unemployment rates; employers no longer offering certain healthcare coverage as an employee benefit or electing to offer coverage on a voluntary employee-funded basis; participation on Public Exchanges; federal and state regulatory changes; failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers; premium increases and benefit changes; our exit from a specific market; negative publicity and news coverage; and failure to attain or maintain nationally recognized accreditations', ' The states in which we operate that have the largest concentrations of revenues include California Florida Georgia Indiana New York Ohio Texas and Virginia', ' Due to this concentration of business in these states we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of state-specific or regional economic downturns impacting these

liabilities', ' We cannot ensure that we will be able to identify prevent or contain the effects of cyber-attacks or other cybersecurity risks that bypass our security measures or disrupt our information technology systems or business', ' We have security technologies processes and procedures in place to protect against cybersecurity risks and security breaches', ' However hardware software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design manufacturer defects or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security', ' In addition because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable disrupt or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these techniques timely discover or counter them or implement adequate preventative measures', ' Viruses worms or other malicious software programs may be used to attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities and such security attacks may cause system disruptions or shutdowns or may cause personal information or proprietary or confidential information to be disclosed misappropriated or compromised', ' This risk is heightened due to the increased number of our employees working from home', ' As a result cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage and unauthorized access remain a priority for us', ' Noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach cyber-attack or cybersecurity breach and any incident involving the misappropriation theft loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of or access to sensitive or confidential information whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers could require us to expend significant resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures and to remediate any damage', ' In addition this could negatively affect our operations cause system disruptions damage our reputation cause membership losses and contract breaches and could also result in regulatory enforcement actions material fines and penalties litigation or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' There are various risks associated with participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs including dependence upon government funding and the timing of payments compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight', ' We contract with various federal and state agencies including CMS to provide managed healthcare services such as Medicare Advantage Medicare Part D Medicare Supplement Medicaid TANF SPD LTSS CHIP Medicaid expansion programs and various

states for the care of dual-eligible members', ' Regulatory reform initiatives or changes in existing laws or regulations applicable to these programs or their interpretations are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent in whole or in part upon annual funding from the federal government andor applicable state governments and base premium rates paid by each state or federal agency differ depending upon a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits a members health status age gender county or region benefit mix member eligibility category and risk scores', ' Future rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain costs as well as federal and state budgetary constraints and certain state contracts are subject to cancellation in the event of the unavailability of state funds', ' Additionally ongoing CMS system changes related to the data it uses to calculate risk scores in the Medicare Advantage program may impact our federal funding', ' If the federal government or any state in which we operate were to decrease rates paid to us pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends cancel our contracts retroactively or seek an adjustment to previously negotiated rates it could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' In addition various states MMPs are still subject to uncertainty surrounding payment rates and other requirements which could affect where we seek to participate in these programs', ' An unexpected reduction in payments inadequate government funding or significantly delayed payments for these programs may adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' Other potential risks associated with Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans include increased medical or pharmaceutical costs data corrections identified as a result of ongoing auditing and monitoring activities potential uncollectability of receivables resulting from processing andor verifying enrollment inadequacy of underwriting assumptions inability to receive and process correct information including inability due to systems issues by the federal government the applicable state government or us uncollectability of premiums from members and limited enrollment periods', ' Actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations', ' Finally there is the possibility that the Medicare Advantage program could be significantly impacted by future legislation', ' Our contracts with CMS and state governmental agencies contain certain provisions regarding data submission risk adjustment provider network and directory maintenance quality measures claims payment timely and accurate processing of appeals and grievances oversight of service providers encounter data continuity of care call center performance and other requirements specific to federal and state program regulations', ' We have been subject in the past and may again be in the future to administrative actions fines penalties liquidated damages or retrospective adjustments in payments made to our health plans as a result of a failure to comply with those requirements which has impacted and in the future could impact our profitability', ' Due to decreased utilization of medical facilities and services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic we experienced retroactive rate adjustments by certain state Medicaid agencies and rate adjustments may continue in the future', ' As members have accessed care during the COVID-19 pandemic we have experienced increased difficulty obtaining provider information required by CMS and state governmental agencies and as a result may have difficulty meeting these quality measures', ' In addition we could be required to file a corrective plan of action with additional penalties for noncompliance which could have a negative impact on future membership enrollment levels', ' Further our existing CMS or state Medicaid contracts have not always been renewed we have not always been awarded new contracts as a result of the competitive procurement process and in some cases we have lost members under existing contracts as a result of a post-award challenge by unsuccessful bidders each of which could take place again in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' Further the Star Rating System utilized by CMS to evaluate Medicare Advantage Plans may have a significant effect on our revenue as higher-rated plans tend to experience increased enrollment and plans with a Star rating of 4.0 or higher are eligible for quality-based bonus payments and can market to and enroll members year-round', ' If we do not maintain or continue to improve our Star ratings fail to meet or exceed our competitors Star ratings or if quality-based bonus payments are reduced or eliminated we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans our membership levels results of operations financial condition and cash flows', ' Similarly if we fail to meet or exceed any performance standards imposed by state Medicaid programs in which we participate we may not receive performance-based bonus payments or may incur penalties', ' In addition our failure to comply with federal and state healthcare laws and regulations applicable to our participation in Medicaid and Medicare programs including those directed at preventing fraud abuse and discrimination could result in investigations litigation fines restrictions on or exclusions from program participation or the imposition of corporate integrity agreements or other agreements with a federal or state governmental agency any of which could adversely impact our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' We are periodically subject to government audits including CMS Risk Adjustment Data Validation “RADV audits of our Medicare Advantage Plans to validate diagnostic data patient claims and financial reporting and audits of our Medicare Part D plans by the Medicare Part D Recovery Audit Contractor “RAC as well as state Medicaid RAC programs', ' These audits could result in significant adjustments in payments made to our health plans which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations', ' If we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a RADV or RAC audit or otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to fines civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in these programs and on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations', ' Our Medicare and Medicaid contracts are also subject to various MLR rules including minimum MLR thresholds rebate requirements and audits which could adversely affect our membership and revenues if any of our state Medicare or Medicaid plans do not meet an applicable minimum MLR threshold', ' If a Medicare Advantage MMP or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years it will become ineligible to participate in open enrollment', ' If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years it will be terminated by CMS', ' A change in our healthcare product mix may impact our profitability', ' Our healthcare products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than administrative services products and those healthcare products where the employer groups assume the underwriting risks', ' Individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase our higher-risk healthcare products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for healthcare expenditures', ' Typically government-sponsored programs also involve our higher-risk healthcare products', ' A shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with hospitals physicians PBM service providers and other healthcare providers our business cash flows financial

and supply chain partners and other healthcare providers', ' Healthcare providers may elect not to contract with us and the failure to secure or maintain cost-effective healthcare provider contracts on competitive terms may result in a loss of membership or higher medical costs which could adversely affect our business', ' In addition consolidation among healthcare providers ACO practice management companies and other organizational structures that physicians hospitals and other care providers choose as well as the ability of larger employers to contract directly with providers may change the way that these providers interact with us and change the competitive landscape', ' Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us which may impact our relationship with these providers or affect the way that we price our products and services and estimate our costs and may require us to incur costs to change our operations which could adversely affect our business cash flows financial condition and results of operations', ' In addition price transparency initiatives such as the Health Plan Transparency Rule may impact our ability to obtain or maintain favorable contract terms', ' Our inability to contract with providers or if providers attempt to use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage or the inability of providers to provide adequate care could adversely affect our business', ' In addition we do not have contracts with all providers that render services to our members and as a result may not have a pre-established agreement about the amount of compensation those out-of-network providers will accept for the services they render which can result in significant litigation or arbitration proceedings or provider attempts to obtain payment from our members for the difference between the amount we have paid and the amount they have charged', ' We are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions', ' We contract with various third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technology systems', ' Certain of these third parties provide us with significant portions of our business infrastructure and operating requirements', ' For example a couple of vendors provide us with a wide range of technology infrastructure services including end user help desk and field support data center mainframe storage and database services certain cloud infrastructure and multi-cloud management services and we are subject to the risks of any operational failure termination or other restraints in these arrangements', ' We could become overly dependent

service disruptions or unavailability reduced service quality and effectiveness increased or duplicative costs or an inability to meet our obligations to our customers', ' In addition we may also have to seek alternative service providers which may be unavailable or only available on less favorable contract terms', ' Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business reputation cash flows financial condition and operating results', ' Our PBM services business in particular would be adversely affected if we are unable to contract on favorable terms with third-party vendors including pharmaceutical manufacturers', ' We delegate certain PBM administrative functions such as claims processing and prescription fulfillment to CVS Health pursuant to the CVS PBM Agreement', ' If CVS

interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability', ' In addition federal and state law enforcement officials have issued warnings about potential terrorist activity involving biological and other weapons and natural disasters such as hurricanes and the potential for a widespread pandemic of influenza or other illness coupled with the lack of availability of appropriate preventative medicines could have a significant impact on the health of the population of widespread areas', ' If the United States were to experience widespread bioterrorism or other attacks

of components and raw materials could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales', ' The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials', ' We manufacture our products in numerous manufacturing facilities around the world', ' We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries', ' We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful', ' Further while we seek to diversify our sources of components and materials in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier', ' The COVID-19 pandemic has created delays and shortages in the supply of components and raw

Beteiligungen II GmbH will likely have no other assets from which to repay the loan', ' Furthermore the change in the market value of Sartorius ordinary shares will have an impact on the value appreciation rights acquired in connection with the Loan discussed in the previous paragraph', ' We may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system', ' We are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system ERP', ' The ERP is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team', ' The ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources', ' In implementing the ERP we may experience significant delays increased costs and other difficulties as we already have with some of our earlier deployments', ' Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship product send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business', ' We expect to implement the remaining smaller phases of the ERP platform over the next few years', ' In addition our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our ERP implementation may continue to disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition', ' Recent and planned changes to our organizational structure could negatively impact our business', ' We made significant changes to our organizational structure over the past few years', ' At the beginning of 2020 we restructured the Clinical Diagnostics segment based on functional groups rather than product line divisions', ' We have continued to reorganize aspects of our European operations including the reorganization announced in February 2021. These changes may have unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees labor unrest business disruption disruption of supply attrition of our workforce inability to attract or retain key employees and reduced employee morale or productivity', 'Risks relating to intellectual property rights may negatively impact our business', ' We rely on a combination of copyright trade secret patent and trademark laws and third-party nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights and products', ' However we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable or that meaningful protection or adequate remedies will be available to us', ' For instance unauthorized third parties have attempted to copy our intellectual property reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary or have developed equivalent technologies independently and may do so in the future', ' Additionally third parties have asserted patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us and may do so in the future', ' If we are unable to license or otherwise access protected technology used in our products or if we lose our rights under any existing licenses we could be prohibited from manufacturing and marketing such products', ' From time to time we also must enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation', ' As a result we could incur substantial costs be forced to redesign our products or be required to pay damages or royalties to an infringed party', ' Any of the foregoing matters could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition', ' Global economic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our operations', ' In recent years we have been faced with very challenging global economic conditions', ' The COVID-19 pandemic as discussed above is currently causing disruptions to global economic conditions', ' It is unknown how long such disruptions will continue and whether such disruptions will become more severe', ' A deterioration in the global economic environment may result in a decrease in demand for our products increased competition downward pressure on the prices for our products and longer sales cycles', ' A weakening of macroeconomic conditions may and currently is also adversely affecting our suppliers which could continue to result in interruptions in the supply of the components and raw materials necessary for our products', ' Additionally the United States and other countries such as China and India recently have imposed tariffs on certain goods', ' While tariffs imposed by other countries on U', 'S', ' goods have not yet had a significant impact on our business further escalation of tariffs or other trade barriers could adversely impact our profitability andor our competitiveness', ' See also our risk factors regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and our international operations above and regarding government regulations below', ' Reductions in government funding and the capital spending programs of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition', ' Our customers include universities clinical diagnostics laboratories government agencies hospitals and pharmaceutical biotechnology and chemical companies', ' The capital spending programs of these institutions and companies have a significant effect on the demand for our products', ' Such programs are based on a wide variety of factors including the resources available to make such purchases the availability of funding from grants by governments or government agencies the spending priorities for various types of equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during industry downturns or recessionary periods', ' If government funding to our customers were to decrease or if our customers were to decrease or reallocate their budgets in a manner adverse to us our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected', 'Changes in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition', ' There have been and will continue to be significant changes in the healthcare industry in an effort to reduce costs', ' These changes include The trend towards managed care together with healthcare reform of the delivery system in the United States and efforts to reform in Europe has resulted in increased pressure on healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry to reduce selling prices', ' Consolidation among healthcare providers and consolidation among other participants in the healthcare industry has resulted in fewer more powerful groups whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage', ' In particular there has been a consolidation of laboratories and a consolidation of blood transfusion centers', ' These industry trends and competitive forces place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins for products we sell in clinical diagnostic markets', ' Third party payors such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States have reduced their reimbursements for certain medical products and services', ' Our Clinical Diagnostics business is impacted by the level of reimbursement available for clinical tests from third party payors', ' In the United States payment for many diagnostic tests furnished to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries is made based on the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule CLFS a fee schedule established and adjusted from time to time by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS', ' Some commercial payors are guided by the CLFS in establishing their reimbursement rates', ' Laboratories and clinicians may decide not to order or perform certain clinical diagnostic tests if third party payments are inadequate and we cannot predict whether third party payors will offer adequate reimbursement for tests utilizing our products to make them commercially attractive', ' Legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act PPACA and the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 has reduced the payments for clinical laboratory services paid under the CLFS', ' In addition the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 PAMA has made significant changes to the way Medicare will pay for clinical laboratory services which has further reduced reimbursement rates', ' To the extent that the healthcare industry seeks to address the need to contain costs stemming from reform measures such as those contained in the PPACA and the PAMA or in future legislation by limiting the number of clinical tests being performed or the amount of reimbursement available for such tests our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected', ' If these changes in the healthcare markets in the United States and Europe continue we could be forced to alter our approach in selling marketing distributing and servicing our products', ' We are subject to substantial government regulation and any changes in regulation or violations of regulations by us could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations or financial condition', ' Some of our products primarily our Clinical Diagnostic products production processes and marketing are subject to U', 'S', ' federal state and local and foreign regulation including by the FDA in the United States and its foreign counterparts', ' The FDA regulates our Clinical Diagnostic products as medical devices and we are subject to significant regulatory clearances or approvals to market our Clinical Diagnostic products and other requirements including for example recordkeeping and reporting requirements such as the FDAs medical device reporting regulations and reporting of corrections and removals', ' The FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers', ' If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements it can impose a variety of enforcement actions ranging from public warning letters fines injunctions consent decrees and civil penalties to suspension or delayed issuance of approvals seizure or recall of our products total or partial shutdown of production withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted and criminal prosecution', 'The FDA can also require us to repair replace or refund the cost of devices that we manufactured or distributed', ' In addition the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis', ' Changes in the FDAs review of certain clinical diagnostic products referred to as laboratory developed tests which are tests developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory could affect some of our customers who use our Life Science instruments for laboratory developed tests', ' In the past the FDA has chosen to not enforce applicable regulations and has not reviewed such tests for approval', ' However the FDA has issued draft guidance that it may begin enforcing its medical device requirements including premarket submission requirements to such tests', ' Any delay in or failure to receive or maintain clearance or approval for our products could prevent us from generating revenue from these products and adversely affect our business operations and financial results', ' Additionally the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers', ' Regulatory enforcement or inquiries or other increased scrutiny on us could affect the perceived safety and efficacy of our products and dissuade our customers from using our products', ' Many foreign governments have similar rules and regulations regarding the importation registration labeling sale and use of our products', ' Such agencies may also impose new requirements that may require us to modify or re-register products already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market our products in those countries', ' For example the EU adopted the EU in-vitro Diagnostics Regulation the “EU IVDR which includes broad changes regarding in vitro diagnostic devices and medical devices', ' The implementation date for the EU IVDR is May 2022 though the EU Council and Parliament recently signed an amendment that delays certain previously mandated deadlines to allow more time for Notified Body to manage the entire portfolio of IVD products on the European market', ' The EU IVDR will require us to modify or re-register some products and will result in additional costs', ' Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements', ' In addition Russia has enacted more stringent medical product registration and labeling regulations China has enacted stricter labeling requirements and we expect other countries such as Brazil and India to impose more regulations that impact our product registrations', ' Brexit is resulting in additional regulatory requirements associated with goods manufactured and sold in the United Kingdom and additional complexities and delays with respect to goods raw materials and personnel moving between the United Kingdom and the European Union', ' In addition new government administrations may interpret existing regulations or practices differently', ' Due to these evolving and diverse requirements we face uncertain product approval timelines additional time and effort to comply as well as the potential for reduced sales andor fines for noncompliance', ' Increasing protectionism in such countries also impedes our ability to compete with local companies', ' For example we may not be able to participate in certain public tenders in Russia because of increasing measures to restrict access to such tenders for companies without local manufacturing capabilities', ' Certain tenders in China and India also are including local manufacturing preferences or requirements', ' Such regulations could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition', ' See also our risk factors regarding our international operations and regarding global economic and geopolitical conditions above', ' We are also subject to government regulation of the use and handling of a number of materials and controlled substances', ' The U', 'S', ' Drug Enforcement Administration establishes registration security recordkeeping reporting storage distribution and other requirements for controlled substances pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.

investments in complementary companies products and technologies', ' The benefits of any acquisition may prove to be less than anticipated and may not outweigh the costs reported in our financial statements', ' Completing any potential future acquisitions could cause significant diversion of our managements time and resources', ' If we acquire new companies products or technologies we may be required to assume contingent liabilities or record impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets over time', ' Goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and potential periodic goodwill impairment charges amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and other write-offs could harm our operating results', ' Impairment tests are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and minor changes to assumptions could result in impairment losses', ' If the results forecast in our impairment tests are not achieved or business trends vary from the assumptions used in forecasts or external factors change detrimentally future impairment losses may occur as they have occurred in the past', ' Increased antitrust enforcement and greater government scrutiny of mergers in the healthcare sector may impact our ability to consummate acquisitions', ' We cannot assure you that we will successfully overcome these risks or any other

issues could harm our reputation and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition', ' We must adequately address quality issues associated with our products including defects in our engineering design and manufacturing processes as well as defects in third-party components included in our products', ' Our instruments reagents and consumables are complex and identifying the root cause of quality issues especially those affecting reagents or third-party components is difficult', ' We may incur significant costs and expend substantial time in researching and remediating such issues', ' Quality issues could also delay our launching or manufacturing of new products', ' In addition quality issues unapproved uses of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks related to our products could result in product recalls or product liability or other claims being brought against us', ' These issues could harm our reputation impair our relationship with existing customers and harm our ability to attract new customers which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition', ' Lack of key personnel could hurt our business', ' Our products are very technical in nature and we operate in a complex and competitive business environment', ' In general only highly qualified and well-trained scientists have the necessary skills to develop market and sell our products and many of our manufacturing positions require very specialized knowledge and skills', ' In addition the global nature of our business also requires that we have sophisticated and experienced staff to comply with increasingly complex international laws and regulations', ' We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors customers marketing partners and other companies throughout our industry', ' In particular the job market in Northern California where many of our employees are located is very competitive', ' If we do not offer competitive compensation and benefits we may fail to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel which could impair our ability to properly run our business', ' We have experienced increased turnover since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic', ' As conditions improve from the pandemic and more employees return to the workplace from working remotely we anticipate further increases to turnover', ' In addition our recently mandated COVID-19 vaccine policy in the Unites States has resulted in a loss of personnel', 'We may have higher than anticipated tax liabilities', ' We are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions', ' We report our results of operations based on our determination of the amount of taxes owed in various tax jurisdictions in which we operate', ' The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation judgment and calculations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain', ' Our determination of our tax liabilities is subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various tax jurisdictions', ' Tax authorities have disagreed with our judgment in the past and may disagree with positions we take in the future resulting in assessments of additional taxes', ' Any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition', ' Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes more difficult', ' For example in recent years the tax authorities in Europe have disagreed with our tax positions related to hybrid debt research and development credits transfer pricing and indirect taxes among others', ' We regularly assess the likelihood of the outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes', ' Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals', ' Changes in tax laws or rates changes in the interpretation of tax laws or changes in the jurisdictional mix of our earnings could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations', ' On December

has begun to subside we may again experience material adverse impacts to our business results of operations and cash flows as a result of among other things its global economic impact including any recession that may occur in the future or a prolonged period of economic slowdown or the reluctance of patients to return for elective dental or medical care', ' The impacts and potential impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic include but are not limited to  Significant volatility in supply demand and selling prices for personal protective equipment PPE COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products', ' Available supply customer demand and selling prices for PPE COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products fluctuated in fiscal 2021 and we expect such volatility to continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic', ' This has resulted in inventory reserves fluctuating margins and increased revenue related to such products', ' Although we have experienced significant growth in sales volumes for PPE COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products during the COVID-19 pandemic there can be no assurance that such growth in sales volumes will be maintained during or following the COVID-19 pandemic', ' Our estimates for supply demand and selling prices are inherently uncertain and if supply demand selling prices or other market dynamics significantly fluctuate in the future beyond our current assumptions additional inventory reserves may be required margins may be reduced andor revenue may decline for such products each which could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows', ' Additionally governmental policies designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and variants thereof could once again lead to the closure of dental offices or deferral of elective procedures and wellness exams by medical and dental patients', ' Such previous closures and restrictions impacted our customers spending with us and had and if reinstated may again have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows', ' Although we believe that most practices currently are able to access adequate supply we still may be unable to supply our customers with the specific brand andor quantity of certain PPE products COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products they demand which may lead to our customers seeking alternative sources of supply', ' Healthcare professionals inability to obtain a sufficient quantity andor brand of certain PPE COVID-19 tests and other COVID-19 related products would adversely impact our business results of operations and cash flows and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity', 'Reduction in Peoples Ability and Willingness to be in Public', ' Restrictions recommended by several public health organizations and implemented from time to time by federal state and local governments to slow and limit the transmission of COVID-19 and variants thereof has caused and may in the future cause some people to be less willing to go to elective medical and dental appointments which could again materially adversely affect demand for our products', ' A lengthened period of materially suppressed demand could again cause material adverse impacts on our business results of operations and cash flows and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity;  Potential delays in customer payments or defaults on our customer credit arrangements', ' We generally sell products to customers with payment terms', ' If customers cash flows or operating and financial performance deteriorate due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit they may not be able to pay or may delay payment to us', ' Likewise for similar reasons suppliers may restrict credit or impose more stringent payment terms', ' The inability of current andor potential customers to pay us for our products andor services or any demands by suppliers for more stringent payment terms may materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity and may limit the amounts we can borrow under our trade accounts receivable securitization;  Impact on third parties ability to meet their obligations to us; impact on our ability to meet obligations to third parties', ' Failure of third parties on which we rely including our suppliers contract manufacturers distributors contractors including third-party shippers joint venture partners and external business partners to meet their obligations to us or significant disruptions in their ability to do so which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties travel restrictions and border closures andor other domestic and global supply chain disruptions may materially adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows financial condition and liquidity', ' Certain of our contracts with supply partners contain minimum purchase requirements or include rebate provisions if we satisfy certain sales or purchasing targets that in certain cases we have not been able to satisfy and in other cases we may not be able to fully satisfy due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic', ' Our failure to satisfy such contractual provisions or renegotiate more favorable terms could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and cash flows;  Negative impact on our workforce and impact of adapted business practices', ' The spread of COVID-19 and variants thereof caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or our customers or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees', ' As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold we will continue to evaluate appropriate actions for our business', ' Many of our employees shifted abruptly to working remotely and our office-based workers who are able to work from home continue to do so', ' An extended period of modified business practices and remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on employee morale strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to efficiently operate our business;  Significant changes in political conditions', ' Significant changes in political

mitigate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic', ' Our management is focused on mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which has required and may continue to require for the duration of the pandemic a large investment of time and resources across the Company and may delay certain strategic and other plans which could materially adversely affect our business;  Potential increased costs associated with our self-insured medical insurance programs', ' We may incur significant employee health care costs under our self-insurance medical insurance programs if a large number of our employees andor their covered family members become ill from COVID-19 and variants thereof;  Vaccination or testing mandates', ' The imposition of government or customer mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees attract new employees and retain certain product and service contracts', ' It is possible that a significant number of our employees have not been vaccinated and in the event of a vaccine mandate some of those employees may seek exemptions or otherwise resist vaccination', ' The imposition of vaccine mandates could potentially cause labor shortages if employees refuse to get vaccinated and their employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily', ' Such labor shortages could also affect our ability to retain certain specific contracts to which the mandates may apply reduce our sales andor affect our ability to fulfill customer orders impacting our revenue and profitability', ' Furthermore managing and tracking vaccination status and ongoing testing for exempt andor unvaccinated employees could potentially increase our costs as could addressing inconsistent mandates', ' COVID-19 vaccine mandates and similar regulations have the potential to materially adversely affect our business as the scope nature and effect of such mandates are uncertain at this time; and  Reputational risk associated with response to the COVID-19 pandemic', ' If we do not respond appropriately to the COVID-19 pandemic or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brands which could materially adversely affect our business', ' The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed below any of which could have a material adverse effect on us', ' We are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products', ' We obtain substantially all of the products we distribute from third parties with whom we generally do not have long-term contracts', ' While there is typically more than one source of supply some key suppliers in the aggregate supply a significant portion of the products we sell', ' In 2021 our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 30% and 4% respectively of our aggregate purchases', ' Because of our dependence upon such suppliers our operations are subject to the suppliers ability and willingness to supply products in the quantities that we require and the risks include delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control including a suppliers failure to comply with applicable government requirements which may result in product recalls andor cessation of sales or an interruption in the suppliers manufacturing capabilities', ' In the event of any such interruption in supply we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis', ' There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis if at all and an extended interruption in supply particularly of a high sales volume product could result in a significant disruption in our sales and operations as well as damage to our relationships with customers and our reputation', ' In addition certain of our suppliers have had their ability to service certain markets restricted or negatively impacted because of allegations of forced labor in their supply chain', ' Forced labor legislation affecting the supply chain has increased around the world and the United States recently passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act', ' Our supply chain could be materially disrupted if our suppliers fail to comply with or are unable to satisfy our demand for products as a result of applicable forced labor legislation and regulations', ' Our future growth especially for our technology and value-added services segment is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire and maintain and protect new products and technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins', ' Our future success depends on our ability to timely develop or obtain the right to sell competitive and innovative particularly for our technology and value-added services segment products and services and to market them quickly and cost-effectively', ' Our ability to anticipate customer needs and emerging trends and develop or acquire new products services and technologies at competitive prices requires significant resources including employees with the requisite skills experience and expertise particularly in our technology segment including dental practice management patient engagement and demand creation software solutions', ' The failure to successfully address these challenges could materially disrupt our sales and operations', ' Additionally our software and e-services products like software products generally may contain undetected errors or bugs when introduced or as new versions are released', ' Any such defective software may result in increased expenses related to the software and could adversely affect our relationships with customers as well as our reputation', ' With respect to certain software and e-services that we develop we rely primarily upon copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as contractual and common law protections and confidentiality obligations', ' We cannot provide assurance that such legal protections will be available adequate or enforceable in a timely manner to protect our software or e-services products', ' Our expansion through acquisitions and joint ventures involves risks and may not result in the benefits and revenue growth we expect', ' One of our business strategies has been to expand our domestic and international markets in part through acquisitions and joint ventures and we expect to continue to make acquisitions and enter into joint ventures in the future', ' Such transactions require significant management attention may place significant demands on our operations information systems and financial resources and there is risk that one or more may not succeed', ' We cannot be sure for example that we will achieve the benefits of revenue growth that we expect from these acquisitions or joint ventures or that we will avoid unforeseen additional costs or expenses', ' Our ability to successfully implement our acquisition and joint venture strategy depends upon among other things the following  the availability of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates at acceptable prices;  our ability to consummate such transactions which could potentially be prohibited due to U', 'S', ' or foreign antitrust regulations;  the liquidity of our investments and the availability of financing on acceptable terms;  our ability to retain customers or product lines of the acquired businesses or joint ventures;  our ability to retain recruit and incentivize the management of the companies we acquire; and  our ability to successfully integrate these companies operations services products and personnel with our culture management policies internal procedures working capital management financial and operational controls and strategies', ' Furthermore some of our acquisitions and future acquisitions may give rise to an obligation to make contingent payments or to satisfy certain repurchase obligations which payments could have material adverse impacts on our financial results individually or in the aggregate', ' Certain provisions in our governing documents and other documents to which we are a party may discourage third parties from seeking to acquire us that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares', ' The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us may discourage acquisition bids and may impact the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock', ' These provisions among other things require i the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 60% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote to approve a merger consolidation or a sale lease transfer or exchange of all or substantially all of our assets; and ii the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 23% of our common stock entitled to vote to a remove a director; and b to amend or repeal our by-laws with certain limited exceptions', ' In addition certain of our employee incentive plans provide for accelerated vesting of stock options and other awards upon termination without cause within two years following a change in control or grant the plan committee discretion to accelerate awards upon a change of control', ' Further certain agreements between us and our executive officers provide for increased severance payments and certain benefits if those executive officers are terminated without cause by us or if they terminate for good reason in each case within two years following a change in control or within ninety days prior to the effective date of the change in control or after the first public announcement of the pendency of the change in control', 'The health care products distribution industry is highly competitive including without limitation competition from third-party online commerce sites and consolidating and we may not be able to compete successfully', ' We compete with numerous companies including several major manufacturers and distributors', ' Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do which could allow them to compete more successfully', ' Most of our products are available from several sources and our customers tend to have relationships with several distributors', ' Competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market particular products which we would then be unable to market', ' Manufacturers also could increase their efforts to sell directly to end-users and thereby eliminate or reduce our role in distribution', ' Industry consolidation among health care product distributors and manufacturers price competition product unavailability whether due to our inability to gain access to products or to interruptions in manufacturing supply or the emergence of new competitors also could increase competition', ' Consolidation has also increased among manufacturers of health care products which could have a material adverse effect on our margins and product availability', ' We could be subject to charges and financial losses in the event we fail to satisfy minimum purchase commitments contained in some of our contracts', ' Additionally traditional health care supply and distribution relationships are being challenged by electronic online commerce solutions', ' The continued advancement of online commerce by third parties will require us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies to enhance existing services and to differentiate our business including with additional value-added services to address changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis', ' The emergence of such potential competition and our inability to anticipate and effectively respond to changes on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business', ' The repeal or judicial prohibition on implementation of the Affordable Care Act could materially adversely affect our business', ' The ACA greatly expanded health insurance coverage in the United States and has been the target of litigation and Congressional reform efforts since its adoption', ' The U', 'S', ' Supreme Court in upholding the constitutionality of the ACA and its individual mandate provision in 2012 simultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid expansion making such expansion a state-by-state decision', ' In 2017 the U', 'S', ' Congress effectively repealed the ACAs individual mandate provision by eliminating the financial penalty for non-compliance', ' In the most recent ACA litigation a federal appeals court found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional and returned the case to a lower federal court for consideration of whether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual mandate', ' This decision was appealed to the U', 'S', ' Supreme Court and the Supreme Court issued a decision on June 17 2021. Without reaching the merits of the case the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs in the case did not have standing to challenge the ACA', ' Any outcome of future cases that change the ACA in addition to future legislation regulation guidance andor Executive Orders that do the same could have a significant impact on the U', 'S', ' healthcare industry', ' For instance the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enhanced premium tax credits which has resulted in an expansion of the number of people covered under the ACA', ' These changes are time-limited with some enhancements in place for 2021 only and others available through the end of 2022. The health care industry is experiencing changes due to political economic and regulatory influences that could materially adversely affect our business', ' The health care industry is highly regulated and subject to changing political economic and regulatory influences', ' In recent years the health care industry has undergone and is in the process of undergoing significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs including among other factors trends toward managed care; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based health care practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers including increased attention to value-based payment arrangements as well as growing enforcement activities and related monetary recoveries by governmental officials', ' Both our profitability and the profitability of our customers may be materially adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals medical supplies and devices andor medical treatments or services or changes to the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined', ' If we are unable to react effectively to these and other changes in the health care industry our business could be materially adversely affected', 'Expansion of group purchasing organizations “GPO dental support organizations “DSO or provider networks and the multi-tiered costing structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage', ' The health care products industry is subject to a multi-tiered costing structure which can vary by manufacturer andor product', ' Under this structure certain institutions can obtain more favorable prices for health care products than we are able to obtain', ' The multi-tiered costing structure continues to expand as many large integrated health care providers and others with significant purchasing power such as GPOs and DSOs demand more favorable pricing terms', ' Additionally the formation of provider networks GPOs and DSOs may shift purchasing decisions to entities or persons with whom we do not have a historical relationship and may threaten our ability to compete effectively which could in turn negatively impact our financial results', ' Although we are seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers to access lower prices demanded by GPO and DSO contracts or other contracts and to develop relationships with existing and emerging provider networks GPOs and DSOs we cannot guarantee that such terms will be obtained or contracts executed', ' Increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers could harm our business', ' Our ability to meet our customers expedited delivery expectations is an integral component of our business strategy for which our customers rely', ' Shipping is a significant expense in the operation of our business', ' We ship almost all of our orders through third-party delivery services and typically bear the cost of shipment', ' Accordingly any significant increase in shipping rates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results', ' Similarly strikes or other service interruptions by those shippers including at transportation centers or shipping ports could cause our operating expenses to rise and materially adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis', 'Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition', ' Uncertain global macro-economic and political conditions that affect the economy and the economic outlook of the United States Europe Asia and other parts of the world could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition', ' These uncertainties include among other thingselection results;  changes to laws and policies governing foreign trade including without limitation the United

of certain tax deductions;  increases in health care costs;the threat or outbreak of war terrorism or public unrest including without limitation the possibility of war in the Ukraine and a wider European or global conflict; and  changes in laws and policies governing manufacturing development and investment in territories and countries where we do business', ' Additionally changes in government government debt andor budget crises may lead to reductions in government spending in certain countries which could reduce overall health care spending andor higher income or corporate taxes which could depress spending overall', ' Recessionary or inflationary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending may also cause customers to reduce modify delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may cause suppliers to reduce their output or change their terms of sale', ' We generally sell products to customers with payment terms', ' If customers cash flow or

efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing', ' In the United States in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress the President executive branch agencies and various states', ' At the state level several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases while others have taken legislative

sales', ' Our failure to renew our contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations', ' In addition if we are unable to develop new relationships with GPOs our competitive position would likely suffer and our opportunities to grow our revenues and business would be harmed', ' Inadequate levels of coverage or reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payers for our products or for procedures using our products may cause our revenue to decline or prevent us from realizing revenues from future products', ' Sales of our products depend in part on the reimbursement and coverage policies of governmental and private healthcare payers', ' The lack of adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products or the procedures in which our products are used may deter customers from purchasing our products', ' We cannot guarantee that governmental or third-party payers will reimburse or begin reimbursing a customer for the cost of our products or the procedures in which our products are used', ' For example some insurance carriers have issued policies denying coverage for transcutaneous hemoglobin measurement on the grounds that the technology is investigational in the outpatient setting', ' Other payers are continuing to investigate our products to determine if they will provide reimbursement for the use of such products', ' These trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our current and future products hinder our ability to obtain market adoption cause a decrease in the size of the market or potentially increase competition any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations', ' We do not control payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for our products', ' Additionally we expect many payers to continue to explore cost-containment strategies e', 'g', ' comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses so-called “pay-for-performance programs implemented by various public government healthcare programs and private third-party payers and expansion of payment bundling initiatives and other such methods that shift medical cost risk to providers that may potentially impact coverage andor payment levels for our current products or products we develop in the future', ' Outside of the U', 'S', ' reimbursement systems vary by country', ' These systems are often subject to the same pressures to curb rising healthcare costs and control healthcare expenditures as those in the U', 'S', ' In addition as economies of emerging markets develop these countries may implement changes in their healthcare delivery and payment systems', ' If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers outside of the U', 'S', ' are not obtained sales of our products outside of the U', 'S', ' may be adversely affected', 'Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of existing market participants from certain markets which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition', ' Because healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators regulators and third-party payers to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power', ' As the healthcare industry consolidates competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense', ' This has resulted in and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain existing market participants from important market segments as GPOs independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals', ' We expect that market demand government regulation third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to impact the worldwide healthcare industry resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers which may reduce competition exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations', ' Our customers may reduce delay or cancel purchases due to a variety of factors such as lower hospital census levels or third-party guidelines which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', ' Our customers are facing growing levels of uncertainties including variations in overall hospital census for paying patients and the impact of such census variations on hospital budgets', ' As a result many hospitals are reevaluating their entire cost structure including the amount of capital they allocate to medical device technologies and products', ' In addition certain of our products including our rainbow® measurements such as carbon monoxide methemoglobin and hemoglobin that are sold with upfront license fees and more complex and expensive sensors could also be impacted by hospital budget reductions', ' Any reductions in capital spending budgets by hospitals could have a significant negative impact on our OEM customers who due to their traditionally larger capital equipment sales model could see declines in purchases from their hospital customers', ' This in turn could reduce our board sales to our OEM customers', ' From time to time states and other local regulatory authorities may issue guidelines regarding the appropriate scope and use of our products', ' For example some of our noninvasive monitoring devices may be subject to authorization by individual states as part of the Emergency Medical Services EMS scope of practice procedures', ' A lack of inclusion into scope of practice procedures may limit adoption of our products', ' Additionally increases in demand resulting from global medical crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic may be short lived', ' If the increased demand results in a stockpiling of our products by or excess inventory at our customers future orders may be delayed or canceled until such on-hand inventory is consumed', ' The loss of any large customer or distributor or any cancellation or delay of a significant purchase by a large customer could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results', ' We have a concentration of OEM distributor and direct customers', ' For example sales to two just-in-time distributors each represented 10% or more of our product sales for the year ended January 1 2022. We cannot provide any assurances that we will retain our current customers groups of customers or distributors or that we will be able to attract and retain additional customers in the future', ' If for any reason we were to lose our ability to sell to a specific group or class of customers or through a distributor we could experience a significant reduction in revenue which would adversely impact our operating results', ' Our sales could also be negatively affected by any rebates discounts or fees that are required by or offered to GPOs and customers including wholesalers or distributors', ' Additionally some of our just-in-time distributors have been demanding higher fees which we may be obligated to pay in order to continue to offer products to our customers through these distributors or which may obligate us to distribute our products directly to our customers', ' The loss of any large customer or distributor an increase in distributor fees or the risks associated with selling directly to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations', 'Counterfeit Masimo sensors and third-party reprocessed single-patient-use Masimo sensors may harm our reputation', ' Also these counterfeit and third-party reprocessed sensors as well as genuine Masimo reprocessed sensors are sold at lower prices than new Masimo sensors and could cause our revenue to decline which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', ' We believe that other entities are manufacturing and selling counterfeit Masimo sensors', ' In addition certain medical device reprocessors have been collecting our used single-patient-use sensors from hospitals and then reprocessing repackaging and reselling those sensors to hospitals', ' These counterfeit and third-party reprocessed sensors are sold at lower prices than new Masimo sensors', ' Our experience with both these counterfeit sensors and third-party reprocessed sensors is that they provide inferior performance increased sensor consumption reduced comfort and a number of monitoring problems', ' Notwithstanding these limitations some of our customers have indicated a willingness to purchase some of their sensor requirements from these counterfeit manufacturers and third-party reprocessors in an effort to reduce their sensor costs', ' These counterfeit and reprocessed sensors have led and may continue to lead to confusion with our genuine Masimo products have reduced and may continue to reduce our revenue and in some cases have harmed and may continue to harm our reputation if customers conclude incorrectly that these counterfeit or reprocessed sensors are original Masimo sensors', ' In addition we have expended a significant amount of time and expense investigating issues caused by counterfeit and reprocessed sensors troubleshooting problems stemming from such sensors educating customers about why counterfeit and reprocessed sensors do not perform to their expectations enforcing our proprietary rights against the counterfeit manufacturers and reprocessors and enforcing our contractual rights', ' In response to these counterfeit sensors and third-party reprocessors we have incorporated X-Cal® technology into certain products to ensure our customers get the performance they expect by using genuine Masimo sensors and that such sensors do not continue to be used beyond their useful life', ' However some customers may object to the X-Cal® technology potentially resulting in the loss of customers and revenues', ' We also offer our own Masimo reprocessed sensors which meet the same performance specifications as our new Masimo sensors to our customers', ' Reprocessed sensors sold by us are also offered at a lower price and therefore may reduce certain customer demand for our new sensors', ' As a result increased sales of our own Masimo reprocessed sensors may result in lower revenues which could negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations', 'If the patents we own or license or our other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our technologies we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably', ' Our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products', ' Our utilization of patent protection trade secrets and a combination of copyright and trademark laws as well as nondisclosure confidentiality and other contractual arrangements to protect our intellectual property afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or maintain any competitive advantage', ' Certain of our patents related to our technologies have begun to expire', ' Upon the expiration of our issued or licensed patents we generally lose some of our rights to exclude competitors from making using selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents', ' Furthermore in recent years the U', 'S', ' Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases and several laws have been enacted that in certain situations potentially narrow the scope of patent protection available and weaken the rights of patent owners', ' As a result we believe large technology companies may be pursuing an “efficient infringement strategy having concluded that it is cheaper to infringe third party intellectual property rights than to acquire license or otherwise respect them', ' There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing additional patents on commercially desirable improvements that such additional patents will adequately protect our innovations or offset the effect of expiring patents or that competitors will not be able to design around our patents', ' In addition third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge our issued patents through procedures such as Inter-Partes Review IPR', ' In many IPR challenges the U', 'S', ' Patent and Trademark Office PTO cancels or significantly narrows issued patent claims', ' IPR challenges could increase the uncertainties and costs associated with the maintenance enforcement and defense of our issued and future patents and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations', ' We also utilize unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and often rely on confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees OEM partners independent distributors and consultants to protect such unpatented proprietary technology and know-how', ' However such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information', ' We rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products', ' Common law trademarks provide less protection than registered trademarks', ' Loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', ' If third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products', ' Searching for existing intellectual property rights may not reveal important intellectual property and our competitors may also have filed for patent protection which may not be publicly-available information or claimed trademark rights that have not been revealed through our searches', ' In addition some of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies', ' We may be subject to claims that our employees have disclosed or that we have used trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees former employers', ' Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties intellectual property rights may not always be successful', ' Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us even those without merit could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and result in payment of significant damages to third parties; force us to stop making or selling products that incorporate the intellectual property; require us to redesign reengineer or rebrand our products product candidates and technologies; require us to enter into royalty agreements that would increase the costs of our products; require us to indemnify third parties pursuant to contracts in which we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement claims; divert the attention of our management and other key employees; and result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products impacted by the claims until the claims are resolved; any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations', ' In addition new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten the continued commercialization of our products in the market even after they have already been introduced', ' We believe competitors may currently be violating and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights', ' As a result we may initiate litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights which may result in substantial expense and may divert managements attention from implementing our business strategy', ' We believe that the success of our business depends in part on obtaining patent protection for our products and technologies defending our patents and preserving our trade secrets', ' We were previously involved in significant litigation to protect our patent positions related to some of our pulse oximetry signal processing patents that resulted in various settlements', ' We believe some of the new market entrants in the healthcare and monitoring space including some of the worlds largest technology companies may be infringing our intellectual property and we may be required to engage in additional litigation to protect our intellectual property in the future', ' In addition we believe that certain individuals who previously held high level technical and clinical positions with us misappropriated our intellectual property for the benefit of themselves and other companies', ' For example on January 9 2020 we initiated litigation against Apple Inc', ' for infringement of a number of patents for trade secret misappropriation and for ownership and correction of inventorship of a number of Apple Inc', ' patents that list one of our former employees as an inventor', ' Our ongoing and future litigation could result in significant additional costs and further divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and the implementation of our business strategy and may not be successful or adequate to protect our intellectual property rights', ' The laws of foreign countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights', ' Intellectual property protection laws in foreign countries differ substantially from those in the U', 'S', ' If we fail to apply for intellectual property protection in foreign countries or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business financial condition and results of operations', 'Our failure to obtain and maintain FDA clearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all would prevent us from commercializing our current upgraded or new products in the U', 'S', ' which could severely harm our business', ' Unless an exemption applies each medical device that we market in the U', 'S', ' must first undergo premarket review pursuant to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act FDCA by receiving clearance of a 510k premarket notification receiving clearance through the de novo classification review process or obtaining approval of a premarket approval PMA application', ' Even if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted the U', 'S', ' Food and Drug Administration FDA may clear or approve our products only for limited indications for use', ' Additionally the FDA may not grant 510k clearance on a timely basis if at all for new products or new uses that we propose for Masimo SET® or licensed rainbow® technology', ' The traditional FDA 510k clearance process for our products has generally taken between four to nine months', ' However our more recent experience and interactions with the FDA along with information we have received from other medical device manufacturers suggests that in some cases the FDA is requiring applicants to provide additional or different information and data for 510k clearance than it had previously required and that the FDA may not rely on approaches that it had previously accepted to support 510k clearance', ' As a result FDA 510k clearance can be delayed for our products in some cases', ' To support our product applications to the FDA we frequently are required to conduct clinical testing of our products', ' Such clinical testing must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements pertaining to human research', ' Among other requirements we must obtain informed consent from study subjects and approval by institutional review boards before such studies may begin', ' We must also comply with other FDA requirements such as monitoring record-keeping reporting and the submission of information regarding certain clinical trials to a public database maintained by the National Institutes of Health', ' In addition if the study involves a significant risk device we are required to obtain the FDAs approval of the study under an Investigational Device Exemption IDE', ' Compliance with these requirements can require significant time and resources', ' In addition public health emergencies and other extraordinary circumstances may disrupt the conduct of our clinical trials', ' If the FDA determines that we have not complied with such requirements the FDA may refuse to consider the data to support our applications or may initiate enforcement actions', ' Even though 510k clearances have been obtained if safety or effectiveness problems are identified with our products we may need to initiate a recall of such products', ' Furthermore our new products or significantly modified marketed products could be denied 510k clearance and be required to undergo the more burdensome PMA or de novo classification review processes', ' The process of obtaining a de novo classification or PMA approval is much more costly lengthy and uncertain than the process for obtaining 510k clearance', ' De novo classification review generally takes six months to one year from the time of submission of the de novo request although it can take longer', ' Approval of a PMA generally takes one year from the time of submission of the PMA but may be longer', ' We sell consumer versions of our iSpO2® and MightySat® pulse oximeters that are not intended for medical use', ' Some of our products or product features may not be subject to the 510k process andor other regulatory requirements in accordance with specific FDA guidance and policies such as the FDA guidance related to mobile medical applications', ' In addition some of our products or product features may not be subject to device regulation pursuant to Section 520o of the FDCA which excludes certain software functions from the statutory definition of a device', ' In addition we may market certain products pursuant to enforcement discretion policies the FDA previously announced to address the need for these products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic', ' Such policies only remain in effect during the public health emergency such that we will need to seek clearance or approval of such products to continue marketing these products at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic', ' If the FDA changes its policies or concludes that our marketing of these products is not in accordance with its current policies andor Section 520o of the FDCA we may be required to seek clearance or approval of these devices through the 510k de novo classification review or PMA processes', ' The failure of our OEM partners to obtain required FDA clearances or approvals for products that incorporate our technologies could have a negative impact on our revenue', ' Our OEM partners are required to obtain their own FDA clearances in the U', 'S', ' for most products incorporating Masimo technologies', ' The FDA clearances we have obtained may not make it easier for our OEM partners to obtain clearances of products incorporating these technologies or the FDA may not grant clearances on a timely basis if at all for any future products incorporating Masimo technologies

some cases pricing approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities', ' The regulatory registrationlicensing process varies among international jurisdictions and may require additional or different product testing than required to obtain FDA clearance', ' FDA clearance does not ensure new product registrationlicensing by foreign regulatory authorities and we may be unable to obtain

operations could be adversely affected', ' Furthermore foreign regulatory requirements may change from time to time which could adversely affect our ability to market new products andor continue to market existing products internationally', ' Certain significant changes in the international regulatory landscape have recently taken place or will take place in the near future', ' These include the new EU Medical Devices Regulation EU 2017745 MDR which came into effect on May 26 2021 and a new regulatory regime in the UK effective since January 1 2021 as a result of the UKs exit from the EU and the expiry of the transitional periods', ' Modifications to our marketed devices may require new regulatory clearances or premarket approvals or may require us to cease marketing or to recall the modified devices until clearances or approvals are obtained', ' We have made modifications to our devices in the past and we may make additional modifications in the future', ' Any modification to a device that is cleared by the FDA that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that could constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new clearance or approval and certain modifications to devices cleared or approved by foreign regulatory authorities may also require a new clearance or approval', ' We may not be able to obtain such clearances or approvals in a timely fashion or at all', ' Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations', ' For device modifications that we conclude do not require a new regulatory clearance or approval we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices if the government agency disagrees with our conclusion and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications', ' This could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations', ' During the COVID-19 pandemic the FDA has issued enforcement policies under which the agency has said it will not require clearance of a new 510k for certain modifications to 510k-cleared non-invasive vital-sign patient monitoring devices', ' However these policies remain in effect only during the COVID-19 pandemic', ' Manufacturers that make modifications pursuant to these policies will need to stop marketing the modifications at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic unless the manufacturer receives 510k clearance for the modifications', ' Regulatory reforms may impact our ability to develop and commercialize our products and technologies', ' From time to time legislation is drafted and introduced by governments that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval manufacture and marketing of medical devices', ' For example in August 2017 Congress enacted the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 FDARA', ' FDARA reauthorized the FDA to collect device user fees including a new user fee for de novo classification requests and contained substantive amendments to the device provisions of the FDCA', ' Among other changes FDARA required that the FDA update and revise its processes for scheduling inspections of device establishments communicating about those inspections with manufacturers and providing feedback on the manufacturers responses to Form 483s', ' The statute also required that the FDA study the impact of device servicing including third-party services and created a new process for device sponsors to request classification of accessory devices as part of the PMA application for the parent device or to request a separate classification of accessory devices', ' In addition regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the government agency in ways that may significantly affect our business or products', ' Future regulatory changes could make it more difficult for us to obtain or maintain approval to develop and commercialize our products and technologies', ' Public health emergencies may also prompt temporary or permanent regulatory reforms that could change the processes governing the clearance or approval manufacture and marketing of medical devices', 'In the EU for example the new MDR became applicable to our medical devices on May 26 2021. The MDR requires medical devices and their manufacturers to comply with more stringent standards than before', ' The MDR also imposes new and enhanced obligations on importers and distributors of medical devices in the EU', ' Although the MDR is subject to certain transitional periods both we and others involved in the distribution and commercialization of our medical devices in the EU will need to comply with more stringent EU rules', ' Due to Brexit from January 1 2021 a new regulatory framework applies to medical devices commercialized in Great Britain England Scotland and Wales', ' This is now separate from the regime in the EU', ' Although certain transition periods apply until June 30 2023 the medical devices we intend to commercialize in Great Britain will need to conform to different requirements than the requirements in the EU', ' These factors are likely to add more complexity to our regulatory compliance obligations in Europe and our ability to commercialize medical devices in European markets', ' If our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations and may need to initiate voluntary corrective actions or in certain circumstances be required to take corrective actions such as the recall of our products', ' Regulatory agencies in many countries require us to report anytime our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury', ' For example under the FDA medical device reporting regulations we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which a product of ours may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which a product of ours malfunctioned and if the malfunction were to recur would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury', ' In addition all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU are legally required to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices produced or sold by the manufacturer to the relevant authority in those jurisdictions where any such incident occurred', ' The FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to require the recall of our commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in for example design labeling or manufacture', ' The FDA must find that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death in order to require a recall', ' The standard for recalling deficient products may be different in foreign jurisdictions', ' Manufacturers may under their own initiative recall a product if any material deficiency is found in a device or they become aware of a safety issue involving a marketed product', ' A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or by one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures manufacturing errors design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues', ' We may initiate certain field actions such as a product correction or removal of our products in the future', ' In addition third parties that commercialize products incorporating our technologies may initiate similar actions or product corrections', ' Any correction or removal initiated by us to reduce a health risk posed by our device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA or other regulations caused by the device that may present a risk to health must be reported to the FDA', ' If the FDA subsequently determines that a report was required for a correction or removal of our products that we did not believe required a report we could be subject to enforcement actions', ' Any recalls or corrections of our products or third party products that incorporate our technologies or enforcement actions would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations', ' In addition given our dependence upon patient and physician perceptions any negative publicity associated with any recalls could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and growth prospects', ' Promotion of our products using claims that are off-label unsubstantiated false or misleading could subject us to substantial penalties', ' Obtaining 510k clearance permits us to promote our products for the uses cleared by the FDA', ' Use of a device outside its cleared or approved indications is known as “off-label use or promotion respectively', ' Physicians may use our products off-label because the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physicians choice of treatment within the practice of medicine but we may not promote our products “off-label', ' While we may request additional cleared indications for our current products the FDA may deny those requests require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared product as a condition of clearance', ' If the FDA determines that our products were promoted for off-label use or that false misleading or inadequately substantiated promotional claims have been made by us or our OEM partners it could request that we or our OEM partners modify those promotional materials or it could take regulatory or enforcement actions including the issuance of an untitled letter warning letter injunction seizure civil fine and criminal penalties', ' While certain U', 'S', ' courts have held that truthful non-misleading off-label information is protected under the First Amendment under certain circumstances the FDA continues to take the position that off-label promotion is subject to enforcement action', 'It is also possible that other federal state or foreign enforcement authorities may take action if they consider our communications including promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use', ' If not successfully defended enforcement actions related to off-label promotion could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement', ' In any such event our reputation could be damaged adoption of our products could be impaired and we could be subject to extensive fines and penalties', ' Additionally we must have adequate substantiation for the claims we make for our products', ' If any of our claims are determined to be false misleading or deceptive our products could be considered misbranded under the FDCA or in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act', ' We could also face lawsuits from our competitors under the Lanham Act alleging that our marketing materials are false or misleading', ' The regulatory environment governing information cybersecurity and privacy is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve', ' Personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the U', 'S', ' Europe and many other jurisdictions where we offer our products', ' The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain

significant statutory damage awards as well as injunctive or declaratory relief if there has been unauthorized access theft or disclosure of specified personal information due to failure to implement reasonable security procedures', ' The California Privacy Rights Act CPRA which will go into effect on January 1 2023 with a twelve month look-back period for enforcement purposes will effectively replace the CCPA', ' Among other changes the CPRA expands consumers rights and has enhanced enforcement mechanisms such as the creation of a new California privacy agency that will investigate and enforce the CPRA and its promulgating regulations', ' In addition to the CCPA and the CPRA all 50 U', 'S', ' states have data breach notification laws that if violated could result in penalties fines and litigation', ' In addition many states have implemented or are in the process of implementing related legislation including state-specific biometric privacy laws that have resulted in class-action lawsuits against businesses', ' The full impact of these laws on our business is yet to be determined but it could result in increased operating expenses as well as additional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of consumers', ' Internationally the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR took effect in May 2018 within the European Economic Area EEA and many EEA jurisdictions have also adopted their own data privacy and protection laws in addition to the GDPR', ' Furthermore other international jurisdictions including Singapore South Korea China Brazil Mexico and Australia have also implemented laws relating to data privacy and protection', ' Although we believe that we are complying with the GDPR and similar laws these laws are still relatively new', ' Therefore as

services reimbursed by governmental programs and non-governmental third-party payers including commercial insurers', ' If we are found to have violated any such laws or other similar governmental regulations including their foreign counterparts that are directly or indirectly applicable to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines exclusion of our products from reimbursement under Medicare Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations', ' Any penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results', ' Any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against such action could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements attention from the operation of our business', ' Legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare industry could have a negative impact on our financial performance', ' Furthermore our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be significantly and adversely affected by healthcare reform legislation in the U', 'S', ' or in our key international markets', ' Changes in the healthcare industry in the U', 'S', ' and abroad could adversely affect the demand for our products and the way in which we conduct our business', ' For example the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act the ACA enacted in 2010 required most individuals to have health insurance established new regulations on health plans created insurance-pooling mechanisms and reduced Medicare spending on services provided by hospitals and other providers', ' The long-term viability of the ACA and its impact on our business and results of operations remains uncertain', ' There have also been recent U', 'S', ' Congressional actions to repeal and replace the ACA and future actions are expected', ' For example the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 TCJA among other things eliminated the individual mandate requiring most Americans other than those who qualify for a hardship exemption to carry a minimum level of health coverage effective January 1 2019. In December 2018 a federal district court judge in Texas found the ACAs individual mandate to be unconstitutional; and therefore the entire law to be invalid', ' In December 2019 the Fifth Circuit affirmed the ruling regarding the individual mandate but remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis of the question of severability and whether portions of the law remain valid', ' In June 2021 the U', 'S', ' Supreme Court held that the states and individuals that brought the lawsuit do not have standing to challenge the law effectively ending the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the individual mandate', ' Although we cannot predict the ultimate content or timing of any healthcare reform legislation or other court challenges to the ACA potential changes resulting from any amendment repeal replacement or invalidation of these programs including any reduction in the future availability of healthcare insurance benefits may decrease the number of people who are insured which could adversely affect our business and future results of operations', ' Our medical devices and business activities are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal state and international governmental authorities', ' These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny over the medical device industry', ' In recent years Congress the Department of Justice the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense have issued subpoenas and other requests for information to medical device manufacturers primarily related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers regulatory compliance and marketing and product promotional practices', ' Furthermore certain state governments have enacted legislation to limit andor increase transparency of interactions with healthcare providers pursuant to which we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed by certain states', ' We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and any new regulations or statutory provisions could result in delays or increased costs during the periods of product development clinical trials and regulatory review and approval as well as increased costs to assure compliance', 'Our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic', ' In December 2019 COVID-19 was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan China and has since spread to many other countries including the United States where we have our principal executive offices and principal operations Switzerland where we have our international headquarters and Mexico where we have significant manufacturing operations', ' Government-imposed travel restrictions have resulted and may continue to result in direct operational and administrative disruptions to our domestic and foreign facilities', ' In addition quarantines shelter-in-place and similar orders by local governments have impacted and could further impact the productivity of our manufacturing engineering sales and administrative staff and facilities in the United States and other countries', ' Our operations would be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our business partners were suspected of having contracted COVID-19 which could require quarantine of some or all such employees or closure of our facilities for disinfection', ' If the current pace of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to accelerate due to variants such as the omicron variant and the spread of the virus is not contained in the U', 'S', ' and other jurisdictions where we operate our business operations could be further delayed or interrupted', ' Further any resurgence in infections in the U', 'S', ' or other countries where government restrictions have been fully or partially lifted could result in a re-imposition of such restrictions causing renewed disruptions to our business', ' In the event that government and health authorities may announce new or extend existing restrictions which could include vaccine or testing mandates we may be required to make further adjustments to our operations in order to comply with any such restrictions', ' For example on September 9 2021 the President of the United States issued Executive Order EO 14042 requiring that employees of federal contractors and subcontractors be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and Masimo is a federal contractor', ' However the EO has faced legal challenges in federal courts and there is currently a nationwide injunction on EO 14042. The President of the United States also directed the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Fed-OSHA to issue Emergency Temporary Standards ETS that will direct large employers those with 100+ employees to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees; however on January 13 2022 the U', 'S', ' Supreme Court blocked these regulations from going into effect', ' Though it is difficult to predict whether the injunction on the EO mandate will be lifted if we are ultimately required to mandate vaccines for our employees we may experience workforce constraints due to shortages of vaccinated personnel strains on the labor market limitations on hiring new employees and difficulty retaining and securing employees who are vaccinated', ' In addition our suppliers who are subject to similar vaccination mandates or regulations may experience similar constraints thereby affecting their ability to provide to us with sufficient inventory or material to meet our demands and needs in a timely manner', ' All of these factors could negatively affect our business and operations', ' Furthermore global supply chains and the timely availability of raw materials component parts and products may be materially disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to combat COVID-19 such as quarantines government mandates surrounding vaccinations factory slowdowns or shutdowns border closings and travel restrictions', ' In addition our suppliers have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties in delivering raw materials components and products to us as transportation networks and distribution facilities have been disrupted resulting in delays at ports of arrival', ' Furthermore the availability of shipping containers has decreased and there have been global changes in the types of goods being shipped all of which have resulted in increased shipping costs which may affect the availability of raw materials component parts and products to meet our sales demand', ' For example we utilize semiconductor chips in certain products that we manufacture', ' Semiconductor chips have been subject to an ongoing global supply shortage and our ability to source semiconductor chips or the components that use semiconductor chips may be adversely affected in the future', ' Component delivery lead times have increased and are expected to continue to increase which may cause delays in our production of products and increase the cost to obtain semiconductor chips and components that use semiconductor chips', ' If this semiconductor chip shortage or shortages of other component parts continues we may experience delays production interruptions increased costs and an inability to fulfill engineering design changes or customer demand each of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance', ' The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to extreme volatility in capital markets and a decline in interest rates and has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock', ' While the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict a continued or widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets reducing our ability to access capital which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future', ' The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and financial results continues to depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict', ' If our employees become ill or otherwise incapacitated our operations may be adversely impacted', 'At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic we implemented telework policies wherever possible for appropriate categories of employees in response to various stay at homeshelter in place orders Stay at Home Orders implemented by state and local governments', ' In response to the lifting or partial lifting of the Stay at Home Orders we have reopened our facilities to both “nonessential and “essential employees', ' We have implemented a number of safety measures for our facilities including limiting facility access social distancing face covering temperature checking and increased sanitation standards', ' While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety guidelines in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that our employees will not otherwise be exposed to COVID-19 outside of our workplace', ' If a number of our employees become ill incapacitated or are otherwise unable to continue working during the current or any future pandemic or epidemic our operations may be adversely impacted', ' We may experience conflicts of interest with Cercacor with respect to business opportunities and other matters', ' Prior to our initial public offering in August 2007 our stockholders owned 99% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Cercacor and we believe that a number of our stockholders including certain of our directors and executive officers continue to own shares of Cercacor stock', ' Joe Kiani our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer CEO is also the Chairman and CEO of Cercacor', ' Due to the interrelated nature of Cercacor with us conflicts of interest may arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between us and Cercacor potential acquisitions of businesses or products the development and ownership of technologies and products the sale of products markets and other matters in which our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders may conflict with the best interests of the stockholders of Cercacor', ' In addition we and Cercacor may disagree regarding the interpretation of certain terms in the Cross-Licensing Agreement', ' We cannot guarantee that any conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor or that with respect to our transactions with Cercacor we will negotiate terms that are as favorable to us as if such transactions were with another third-party', ' We will be required to assign to Cercacor and pay Cercacor for the right to use certain products and technologies we develop that relate to the monitoring of non-vital sign parameters including improvements to Masimo SET®', ' Under the Cross-Licensing Agreement if we develop certain products or technologies that relate to the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital sign parameters including improvements to Masimo SET® for the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital sign parameters we would be required to assign these developments to Cercacor and then license the technology back from Cercacor in consideration for upfront payments and royalty obligations to Cercacor', ' Therefore these products and technologies would be deemed to have been developed or improved exclusively by Cercacor', ' In addition we will not be reimbursed by Cercacor for our expenses relating to the development or improvement of any such products or technologies which expenses may be significant', ' As a result of these terms we may not generate any revenue from the further development of certain products and technologies for the monitoring of non-vital sign parameters including improvements to Masimo SET® which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', ' In the event that the Cross-Licensing Agreement is terminated for any reason or Cercacor grants a license to rainbow® technology to a third-party our business would be adversely affected', ' Cercacor owns all of the proprietary rights to certain rainbow® technology developed with our proprietary Masimo SET® for products intended to be used in the “Cercacor Market and all rights to any non-vital signs measurement for which we do not exercise an option pursuant to the Cross-Licensing Agreement', ' In addition Cercacor has the right to terminate the Cross-Licensing Agreement or grant licenses covering rainbow® technology to third parties if we breach certain terms of the agreement including any failure to meet our minimum royalty payment obligations or failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or market products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology', ' If we lose our exclusive license to rainbow® technology we would lose the ability to prevent others from making using selling or importing products using rainbow® technology in our market', ' As a result we would likely be subject to increased competition within our market and Cercacor or competitors who obtain a license to rainbow® technology from Cercacor would be able to offer related products', ' We may not be able to commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology cost-effectively or successfully', ' As a result of the royalties that we must pay to Cercacor it is generally more expensive for us to make products that incorporate licensed rainbow® technology than products that do not include licensed rainbow® technology', ' As a result we may not be able to sell products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology at a price the market is willing to accept', ' If we cannot commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow® technology successfully we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue from these products to be profitable which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', 'Rights provided to Cercacor in the Cross-Licensing Agreement may impede a change in control of our company', ' Under the Cross-Licensing Agreement a change in control includes the resignation or termination of Joe Kiani from his position as CEO of either Masimo or Cercacor', ' A change in control also includes other customary events such as the sale or merger of Masimo or Cercacor to a non-affiliated third-party or the acquisition of 50% or more of the voting power of Masimo or Cercacor by a non-affiliated third-party', ' In the event we undergo a change in control we are required to immediately pay a $2.5 million fee to exercise an option to license technology developed by Cercacor for use in blood glucose monitoring', ' Additionally our per product royalties payable to Cercacor will become subject to specified minimums and the minimum aggregate annual royalties for licensed rainbow® measurements payable to Cercacor related to carbon monoxide methemoglobin fractional arterial oxygen saturation hemoglobin and blood glucose will increase to $15.0 million plus up to $2.0 million for other rainbow® measurements', ' Also if the surviving or acquiring entity ceases to use “Masimo as a company name and trademark following a change in control all rights to the “Masimo trademark will automatically be assigned to Cercacor', ' This could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over our then-current trading price', ' In addition our requirement to assign all future improvements for non-vital signs to Cercacor could impede a change in control of our company', ' If we are unable to obtain key materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers we will not be able to deliver our products to customers', ' We depend on certain sole or limited source suppliers for certain key materials and components including digital signal processor chips and analog-to-digital converter chips for our noninvasive patient monitoring solutions', ' These suppliers are located around the world and the production and shipment of such materials and components may be constrained globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic', ' We may experience manufacturing problems related to these suppliers and other outside sources if such suppliers fail to develop manufacture or ship products and components to us on a timely basis or provide us with products and components that do not meet our quality standards and required quantities', ' We have experienced supply constraints with regard to certain digital signal processor chips and other components during the pandemic but have so far been able to mitigate these constraints', ' In addition from time to time there have been industry-wide shortages of certain components that we use in our noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions', ' We may also experience price increases for materials or components with no guarantee that such increases can be passed along to our customers which could adversely impact our gross margins', ' If any of these problems occur we may be unable to obtain substitute sources for these products and components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us which could harm our ability to manufacture our own products and components profitably or on time', ' Future strategic initiatives including acquisitions of businesses and strategic investments could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations or achieve the desired results of our investment', ' We have acquired several businesses since our inception and we may acquire additional businesses in the future', ' For example on February 15 2022 we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Sound United', ' Future acquisitions may require debt or equity financing which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or reduce our earnings per share or other financial metrics', ' In connection with the pending acquisition of Sound United we received a debt commitment letter for a credit facility in the amount of $800 million and expect to secure this credit facility in the event the proposed acquisition closes', ' Even if we complete acquisitions there are many factors that could affect whether such acquisition will be beneficial to our business including without limitation payment of above-market prices for acquisitions and higher than anticipated acquisition costs; issuance of common stock as part of the acquisition price or a need to issue stock options or other equity to newly-hired employees of target companies resulting in dilution of ownership to our existing stockholders; reduced profitability if an acquisition is not accretive to our business over either the short-term or the long-term; difficulties in integrating any acquired companies personnel products and other assets into our existing business; delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company products or other assets; regulatory challenges and becoming subject to additional regulatory requirements; cybersecurity and compliance-related issues; diversion of our managements time and attention from other business concerns; limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;unanticipated issues dealing with unfamiliar suppliers service providers or other collaborators of the acquired company; higher costs of integration than we anticipated; write-downs or impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets associated with the acquired company; difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions; negative impacts on our relationships with our employees clients or collaborators; intellectual property and other litigation other claims or liabilities in connection with the acquisition; and changes in the overall financial model as certain acquired companies may have a different revenue gross profit margin or operating expense profile', ' Further our ability to benefit from future acquisitions andor external strategic investments depends on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence negotiate acceptable terms evaluate prospective opportunities and bring acquired technologies andor products to market at acceptable margins and operating expense levels', ' For example we acquired TNI medical AG® TNI and added softFlow® technology to our product portfolio during 2020. In addition we acquired LiDCO Group Plc which specializes in hemodynamic monitoring solutions', ' As these are our first therapeutic and hemodynamic monitoring solutions the integration of these technologies may require substantial management time and attention and may divert attention and resources from other important areas including our existing business and product lines and we may not be able to sell softFlow® technology and hemodynamic monitoring solutions at acceptable margins and operating expense levels', ' Our failure in any of these tasks could result in unforeseen liabilities associated with an acquired company acquiring a company on unfavorable terms or selecting and eventually acquiring a suboptimal acquisition target', ' We may also discover deficiencies in internal controls data adequacy and integrity product quality regulatory compliance product liabilities or other undisclosed liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition or investment which could result in us becoming subject to penalties other liabilities or asset impairments', ' In addition if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or other external investment as rapidly as expected or at all investors or analysts may downgrade our stock', ' We also expect to continue to carry out internal strategic initiatives that we believe are necessary to grow our revenues and expand our business both in the U', 'S', ' and abroad', ' For example we have continued to invest in international expansion programs designed to increase our worldwide presence and take advantage of market expansion opportunities around the world', ' Although we believe our investments in these initiatives continue to be in the long-term best interests of Masimo and our stockholders there are no assurances that such initiatives will yield favorable results for us', ' Accordingly if these initiatives are not successful our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected', ' If these risks materialize our stock price could be materially adversely affected', ' Any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties liabilities or asset impairments in connection with such acquisitions or investments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations', ' Our new products and changes to existing products as a result of our proposed acquisition of Sound United could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits', ' Further we may not be successful in our personal consumer strategy and investments which could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results', ' In connection with our proposed acquisition of Sound United we announced an expansion in our business and product strategy to additionally focus on personal consumer products to integrate with our successful medical technology businesses', ' Further we may introduce certain changes to our existing products or introduce new and unproven products', ' We do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies and integrate them with our existing products and platforms', ' We expect this will be a complex evolving and long-term strategic initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies continued investment in medical technology and consumer hardware products and collaboration with other companies developers partners and other participants', ' However our personal consumer business may not develop in accordance with our vision and expectations and market acceptance of features products or services we build for the personal consumer business may be uncertain', ' We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the personal consumer business', ' Our new strategic efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business', ' In addition as our personal consumer business continues to evolve we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions which we were not previously affected by including in the areas of privacy which may delay or impede the development of our products and services increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business', ' As a result of these or other factors our personal consumer strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future or at all which could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results', 'Our credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business', ' Our credit agreement dated December 17 2018 Credit Facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank N', 'A', ' as Administrative Agent and as a lender and Bank of the West as a lender together Lenders contains various affirmative covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions including incurring specified types of additional indebtedness there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional debt or equity financing at the time needed or that such financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us including guarantees or other contingent obligations; paying dividends on repurchasing or making distributions in respect of our common stock or making other restricted payments subject to specified exceptions; making specified investments including loans and advances; selling or transferring certain assets; creating certain liens; consolidating merging selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our assets; and entering into certain transactions with any of our affiliates', ' In addition under our Credit Facility we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other affirmative covenants', ' Our ability to meet those financial ratios and affirmative covenants could be affected by events beyond our control and therefore we cannot be assured that we will be able to continue to satisfy these requirements', ' A breach of any of these ratios or covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility', ' Upon the occurrence of an event of default the Lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility immediately due and payable terminate all commitments to extend further credit and pursue legal remedies for recovery all of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition', ' See Note 15 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part IV Item 15a of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our Credit Facility', ' Our proposed new debt facility which will be used to partially fund our pending acquisition of Sound United may restrict our future operations including our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions', ' If we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under the proposed credit facility the lender may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facility', ' In connection with the pending acquisition of Sound United we recently received a commitment letter for a credit facility in the amount of $800 million and expect to secure this credit facility in the event the pending acquisition closes the “New Debt Facility', ' The New Debt Facility may contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may unless waived by the lender limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests including restrictions on our ability to Incur additional indebtedness; Incur liens; Merge dissolve liquidate amalgamate consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets; Declare or pay certain dividends payments or distribution or repurchase or redeem certain capital stock; and Make certain investments', ' These restrictions could limit potentially significantly our operational flexibility and affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute our business strategy', ' Further if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits from the pending acquisition of Sound United our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted', ' Even if we achieve the anticipated benefits from the pending acquisition we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general corporate purposes', ' Our ability to arrange additional financing and make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness will depend on our future performance which will be subject to general economic financial and business conditions as well as other factors affecting our operations many of which are beyond our control', 'Concentration of ownership of our stock among our existing directors executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions', ' As of January 1 2022 our current directors and executive officers and their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially owned approximately 9.5% of our outstanding stock', ' Subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under Delaware law these stockholders may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions and will have some control over our management and policies in their roles as stockholders', ' Some of these persons or entities may have interests that are different from yours', ' For example these stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree or which are not in your best interests', ' The concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of us or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us which in turn could reduce the price of our stock', ' In addition these stockholders could use their voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office or support or reject other management and Board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions', ' Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company prevent attempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock', ' Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable', ' For example our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to issue up to 5.0 million shares of “blank check preferred stock', ' As a result without further stockholder approval our Board has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock including pursuant to a stockholder rights plan', ' With these rights preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us', ' In addition our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered Board whereby directors serve for three-year terms with one-third of the directors coming up for reelection each year', ' A staggered Board will make it more difficult for a third-party to obtain control of our Board through a proxy contest which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our Board', ' We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware', ' Under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder we may not enter into a “business combination with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third-party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us', ' For purposes of these provisions an “interested stockholder generally means someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware', ' Our bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located within the State of Delaware are the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees', ' Our bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located within

that an indispensable party is not subject to the jurisdiction of Delaware courts or b actions in which a federal court has assumed exclusive jurisdiction to a proceeding', ' This choice of forum provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended the Exchange Act', ' Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder', ' As a result the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees or stockholders which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees or stockholders', ' Furthermore the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable', ' If a court were to find the choice of forum provision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', 'We may experience significant fluctuations in our periodic financial results and may not maintain our current levels of profitability in the future', ' Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future', ' Many of the countries in which we operate including the U', 'S', ' and several of the members of the EU have experienced and continue to experience uncertain economic conditions resulting from global as well as local factors', ' In addition continuing uncertainty in the U', 'S', ' economy may result in continued inflationary pressures globally and in the U', 'S', ' in particular which may contribute to future interest rate volatility', ' Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these uncertain economic conditions including adverse changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates tax laws or tax rates; inflation; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or other economic conditions which may potentially impair our ability to access

conditions or potential global health concerns such as the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our critical customers suppliers and distributors', ' Any negative impact of such matters on our critical customers suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition', ' Our expense levels are based in part on our expectations regarding future revenue levels and are relatively fixed in the short term', ' As a result if our revenue for a particular period was below our expectations we would not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that period', ' Any revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for the period', ' In addition the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies are by their nature subject to substantial risks uncertainties and assumptions', ' Factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods estimates and judgments the impact of which could significantly affect our results of operations', ' See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates contained in Part I Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K', ' Recent accounting changes related to our embedded leases within certain deferred equipment agreements have also resulted in the acceleration of the timing related to our recognition of revenue and expenses associated with certain equipment provided to customers at no up-front charge', ' Since we cannot control the timing of when our customers will request us to deliver such equipment our revenue and costs with respect to leased equipment could vary substantially in any given quarter or year which could further increase quarterly or annual fluctuations within our financial results', ' Due to these and other factors you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance', ' If our operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of

located in earthquake-prone areas', ' We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss attacks from extremist or terrorist organizations epidemics communication failures fire floods and similar events', ' Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial time to repair if significant damage were to result from any of these occurrences', ' If one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a natural or man-made disaster we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers if we could not shift production to our other manufacturing facilities', ' Furthermore our insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all', ' If the lease for any of our leased facilities is terminated we are unable to renew any of our leases or we are otherwise forced to seek alternative facilities or if we voluntarily expand one or more of our manufacturing operations to new locations we may incur additional transition costs and experience a disruption in the supply of our products until the new facilities are available and operating', ' Additionally we have occasionally experienced seasonality among our manufacturing workforce and if we continue to experience such seasonality or other workforce shortages or otherwise have issues retaining employees or contractors at our manufacturing facilities we may not be able to meet our customers demands', ' Our global manufacturing and distribution are dependent upon our manufacturing facilities in Mexico and the expedient importation of raw

under the Mexican Maquiladora IMMEX program', ' The IMMEX program allows us to import certain items from the U', 'S', ' into Mexico duty-free provided that such items after processing are exported from Mexico within a stipulated timeframe', ' Maquiladora status which is renewed periodically is subject to various restrictions and requirements including compliance with the terms of the IMMEX program and other local regulations', ' Failure to comply with the IMMEX program regulations including any changes thereto could increase our manufacturing costs and adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition', ' If we do not accurately forecast customer demand we may hold suboptimal inventory levels that could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', ' If we are unable to meet the demand of our customers our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors which could reduce our revenue and gross profit margin', ' Conversely if product demand decreases we may be unable to timely adjust our manufacturing cost structure resulting in excess capacity which would lower gross product margins', ' Similarly if we are unable to forecast demand accurately we could be required to record charges related to excess or obsolete inventory which would also lower our gross margin', ' If we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting our business results of operations and financial condition and investors confidence in us could be adversely affected', ' We are required to prepare and disclose certain information under the Exchange Act as amended in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety and our failure to do so could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms or at all', ' If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act', ' Moreover any material weakness in our internal control environment could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements which in turn could harm our business negatively impact the trading price of our stock and adversely affect investors confidence in our company and our ability to access capital markets for financing', ' Changing laws and increasingly complex corporate governance and public disclosure requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results', ' Changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank Act the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act the UK Modern Slavery Act and new regulations issued by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC have created and will create additional compliance requirements for us', ' For example the Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions regarding among other things advisory votes on named executive officer compensation and “conflict minerals reporting', ' Complying with these rules and regulations has increased and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources', ' As a result managements attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', ' We may also need to hire additional employees or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements which will increase our costs and expenses', ' To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure we have invested in and intend to continue to invest in reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards', ' In addition stockholder litigation surrounding executive compensation and disclosure of executive compensation has increased with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act', ' Furthermore our stockholders may not continue to approve our advisory vote on named executive officer compensation that is being voted on by our stockholders annually pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act', ' If we are involved in a lawsuit related to compensation matters or any other matters not covered by our directors and officers liability insurance we may incur significant expenses in defending against such lawsuits or be subject to significant fines or required to take significant remedial actions each of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', 'If product liability claims are brought against us we could face substantial liability and costs', ' Our products are predominantly used in patient care and expose us to product liability claims and product recalls including but not limited to those that may arise from unauthorized off-label use malfunctions design flaws or manufacturing defects related to our products or the use of our products with incompatible components or systems', ' In addition as we continue to expand our product portfolio we may enter or create new markets including consumer markets that may expose us to additional product liability risks', ' For example with the acquisition of TNI® in March 2020 we added softFlow® technology to our product portfolio', ' While this technology provides efficient quiet and comfortable respiratory support to patients it may present increased risk of infection to caregivers', ' We cannot be certain that our product liability insurance will be sufficient to cover any or all damages for product liability claims that may be brought against us in the future', ' Furthermore we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts to protect us against any product liability claims', ' Additionally the laws and regulations regarding product liability are constantly evolving both through the passage of new legislation at the state and federal levels and through new interpretations of existing legislation', ' For example in February 2017 the Washington Supreme Court determined that under the Washington Product Liability Act medical device manufacturers have a duty to warn hospitals of any potential risks posed by their products', ' As the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding product liability change we may become exposed to greater liability than currently anticipated', ' Any losses that we may suffer from product liability claims and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our technology and products together with the corresponding diversion of the attention of our key employees may subject us to significant damages and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', ' We may incur environmental and personal injury liabilities related to certain hazardous materials used in our operations', ' Certain manufacturing processes for our products may involve the storage use generation and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes including silicone adhesives solder and solder paste sealants epoxies and various solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone acetone and isopropyl alcohol', ' As a result we are subject to certain environmental laws as well as certain other laws and regulations that restrict the materials that can be used in our products or in our manufacturing processes', ' For example products that we sell in Europe are subject to regulation in the EU markets under the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive RoHS', ' RoHS prohibits companies from selling products that contain certain hazardous materials in EU member states', ' In addition the EUs Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Directive also restricts substances of very high concern in products', ' Compliance with such regulations may be costly and therefore we may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations', ' In addition new environmental laws may further affect how we manufacture our products how we use generate or dispose of hazardous materials and waste or further affect what materials can be used in our products', ' Any required changes to our operations or products may increase our manufacturing costs detrimentally impact the performance of our products add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects', ' In connection with our research and manufacturing activities we use and our employees may be exposed to materials that are hazardous to human health safety or the environment', ' The risk of accidental injury to our employees or contamination from these materials cannot be eliminated and we could be held liable for any resulting damages the related liability for which could exceed our reserves', ' We do not specifically insure against environmental liabilities', ' If an enforcement action were to occur our reputation and our business and financial condition may be harmed even if we were to prevail or settle the action on terms favorable to us', ' We rely significantly on information technology and any failure inadequacy interruption or security lapse of that technology including any cybersecurity incidents could harm our ability to operate our business effectively', ' Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks including the confidentiality availability and integrity of any underlying information and data and those of our customers partners suppliers and third-party service providers', ' Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our internal business information and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning system and other information systems', 'Portions of our information technology systems may experience interruptions delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems implementation work', ' In addition interfaces between our products and our customers computer networks could provide additional opportunities for cybersecurity attacks on us and our customers', ' The techniques used to attack computer systems are sophisticated change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world', ' Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to threats malicious software ransomware attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems misappropriation of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data', ' As a result there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent or detect security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business reputation financial condition and results of operations', ' The failure of these systems to operate or integrate effectively with other internal customer supplier or third-party service provider systems and to protect the underlying information technology system and data integrity including from cyber-attacks intrusions or other breaches or unauthorized access of these systems or any failure by us to remediate any such attacks or breaches may also result in damage to our reputation or competitiveness delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure problem or breach all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations', ' Discontinuation reform or replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business', ' The U', 'K', ' Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate LIBOR by the end of 2023. In addition other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates', ' The discontinuation reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets', ' Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation reform or replacement may also negatively impact interest expense related to borrowings under our Credit Facility', ' Borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest at our election either at the Alternate Base Rate as defined in the Credit Facility or at the Adjusted LIBO Rate as defined in the Credit Facility which is derived from LIBOR', ' We may in the future pursue amendments to our Credit Facility to provide for a transition mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBORs discontinuation but we may not be able to reach agreement with our Lenders on any such amendments', ' As a result additional financing to replace any then-outstanding LIBOR-based debt may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of such outstanding indebtedness', ' Our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value', ' There has been and could continue to be significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities', ' For example our closing stock price ranged from $208.49 to $303.29 per share from January 3 2021 to January 1 2022. Factors contributing to our stock price volatility may include our financial performance as well as broader economic political and market factors including the COVID-19 pandemic', ' In addition to the other risk factors previously discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K there are many other factors that we may not be able to control that could have a significant effect on our stock price', ' These include but are not limited to actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects; our announcements or our competitors announcements of new products; the publics reaction to our press releases our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC; strategic actions by us or our competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings; new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business; changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles; changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates; developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors; ongoing legal proceedings; our inability to raise additional capital as needed; concerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products; changes in financial markets or general economic conditions including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the U', 'S', ' and abroad; effects of public health crises epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic; sales of stock by us or members of our management team our Board or certain institutional stockholders; and changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock other comparable companies or our industry generally', ' Therefore you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them', ' Our investors could experience substantial dilution of their investments as a result of subsequent exercises of our outstanding options vesting of outstanding restricted stock units RSUs and performance stock units PSUs or the grant of future equity awards by us', ' As of January 1 2022 approximately 10.6 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans of which approximately 3.0 million shares were subject to options outstanding at such date at a weighted-average exercise price of $81.38 per share approximately 2.9 million shares were subject to outstanding RSUs approximately 0.3 million shares were subject to outstanding PSUs and approximately 4.4 million shares were available for future awards under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan', ' Over the past 36 months we have experienced higher rates of stock option exercises compared to many earlier periods and this trend may continue', ' To the extent outstanding options are exercised or outstanding RSUs or PSUs vest our existing stockholders may incur dilution', ' We rely on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees', ' The grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other service providers may further dilute our stockholders', ' Future resales of our stock including those by our insiders and a few investment funds may cause our stock price to decline', ' A significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by our directors our executive officers and a few investment funds', ' Resales by these stockholders of a substantial number of such shares announcements of any proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock or the perception that substantial resales may be made could significantly reduce the market price of our stock', ' Some of our directors and executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our stock from time to time in the future', ' Generally these sales require public filings', ' Actual or potential sales by these insiders including those under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan could be interpreted by the market as an indication that the insider has lost confidence in our stock and reduce the market price of our stock', ' We have registered and expect to continue to register shares reserved under our equity plans pursuant to Registration Statements on Form S-8.

including but not limited to the following disruptions to our operations including a shutdown of one or more of our facilities or product lines; restrictions on our operations and sales marketing and distribution efforts; and interruptions to our research and development manufacturing clinicalregulatory and other important business activities; our ability to meet increased demand for our COVID-19 testing products and the costs of expanding our manufacturing capacity to meet such demand; increased costs in our manufacturing production and shipping processes; a slowdown or stoppage in the supply chain of the raw materials components equipment and packaging services used to manufacture our products or our inability to secure additional or alternate sources of supplies or services needed to manufacture our products at optimal levels; our inventory might be requisitioned diverted or allocated by government order such as under emergency disaster and civil defense declarations', ' For example government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected and may in the future affect our supply allocation and those and our own allocation decisions can impact our customer relationships; interruptions or delays in global shipping to transport and deliver our products to our distributors and customers; interruptions in normal operations of certain end user customers that could result in reductions in demand for routine elective and other non-COVID-19 related healthcare procedures and testing; limitations on employee resources and availability including due to sickness

currency exchange rates or interest rates resulting from market uncertainties; an increase in regulatory restrictions or continued market volatility which could hinder our ability to execute strategic business activities including acquisitions; and an increase in the volatility of our stock price', ' In response to increased demand brought on by COVID-19 we have rapidly and significantly expanded and are continuing to expand our manufacturing capacity including expanding and scaling our infrastructure to support existing and anticipated COVID-19 testing demand and commercial activities', ' This rapid expansion has placed and may continue to place significant strain on our management personnel operations systems and financial resources', ' Failure to successfully manage this expansion could negatively affect our operating results including due to inefficiencies in implementing such expansion or higher costs for materials technology equipment and human capital', ' Moreover we may not realize the revenue growth and profitability we anticipate for our COVID-19 and other diagnostic products which could cause among other results a failure to realize the benefits of our manufacturing capacity expansion and the value of those investments being written down or written off', ' Similarly the demand for our COVID-19 testing products could decrease if the COVID-19 pandemic subsides which could result in our having unneeded excess capacity which could in turn cause the value of those investments to be written down or written off', 'The pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing many measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 including travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders and business and school shutdowns', ' Although many of these measures have been lifted or relaxed they could be reinstituted if conditions deteriorate and could be in place for a significant period of time which could adversely affect our operations', ' For example at the outset of the pandemic we temporarily closed our corporate offices and had personnel work remotely to the extent possible and may be required to do so again in

ultimate impacts to us of COVID-19 are uncertain but such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business strategy financial performance and financial condition', ' The industry and market segment in which we operate are highly competitive and intense competition with other providers of diagnostic products or services may reduce our sales and margins', ' Our diagnostic tests compete with similar products made by our competitors', ' There are a large number of multinational and regional competitors making investments in competing technologies and products including several large pharmaceutical and diversified healthcare companies', ' We also face competition from our distributors as some have created and others may decide to create their own products to compete with ours', ' A number of our competitors have competitive advantages such as substantially greater financial technical research and other resources and larger more established marketing sales distribution and service organizations than we have', ' Moreover some competitors offer broader product lines and have greater name recognition than we have', ' Our operating results could be materially and adversely affected if our competitors products are more effective than ours or take market share from our products through more effective marketing or competitive pricing; our competitors obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that prevent us from offering competing products or services; or our competitors are able to obtain regulatory approvals for products or

tests and if sales or revenues of our COVID-19 or influenza tests decline for any reason our operating results would be materially and adversely affected', ' A significant percentage of our total revenues come from a limited number of our product families', ' In particular revenues from the sale of our COVID-19 and influenza tests represent a significant portion of our total revenues and are expected to remain so for at least the near future', ' For the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 sales of our COVID-19 products accounted for 75% 70% and 0% and influenza products accounted for 4% 8% and 26% respectively of total revenue', ' In addition the gross margins derived from sales of our COVID-19 and influenza tests are significantly higher than the gross margins from many of

share loss or price pressure obsolescence regulatory matters such as loss of EUAs for our COVID-19 products or any other reason our operating results would be materially and adversely affected on a disproportionate basis', ' We rely on a limited number of key distributors that account for a significant portion of our total revenue', ' The loss of any key distributor or an unsuccessful effort by us to directly distribute our products could lead to reduced sales', ' Although we have many distributor relationships in the US the market is dominated by a small number of these distributors', ' Four of our US distributors collectively accounted for approximately 49% 68% and 51% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively', ' In addition we rely on a few key distributors for a majority of our international sales and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future', ' The loss or termination of our relationship with any of these key distributors could significantly disrupt our business unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales to a distributor are taken up by another distributor', ' Finding a suitable alternative to a lost or terminated distributor may pose challenges in our industrys competitive environment and another suitable distributor may not be found on satisfactory terms if at all', ' For instance some distributors already have exclusive arrangements with our competitors and others do not have the same level of penetration into our target markets as our existing distributors', ' If total revenue from any of our other significant distributors were to decrease in any material amount in the future or we are not successful in timely transitioning business from a lost or terminated distributor to one or more new distributors our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected', ' Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the financial soundness of our customers and suppliers', ' If our customers or suppliers operating and financial performance deteriorates our customers may not be able to pay

termination of products supplied to us by suppliers may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition', ' We may not achieve market acceptance of our products among physicians healthcare providers or other customers and this would have a negative effect on future sales', ' A large part of our current business is based on the sale of rapid POC diagnostic tests', ' Our future sales depend on among other matters capture of sales from central laboratories by achieving market acceptance of POC testing from physicians other healthcare providers or other customers', ' If we do not capture sales at the levels anticipated in our budget our total revenue will not be at the levels that we expect and the costs we incur or have incurred may be disproportionate to our sales levels', ' We expect that clinical reference and hospital-based laboratories will continue to compete vigorously against our POC diagnostic products in order to maintain and expand their existing dominance of the overall diagnostic testing market', ' Moreover even if we can demonstrate that our products are more cost-effective save time or have better performance physicians and other healthcare providers may resist changing to POC tests', ' Our failure to achieve market acceptance from physicians healthcare providers or other customers with respect to the use of our diagnostic products would have a negative effect on our future sales', 'Our total revenue could be affected by third-party reimbursement policies and potential cost constraints', ' The end-users of our POC products are primarily physicians and other healthcare providers', ' In the US healthcare providers such as hospitals and physicians who purchase diagnostic products generally rely on third-party payers principally private health insurance plans federal Medicare and state Medicaid to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedure', ' Use of our products would be adversely impacted if physicians and other healthcare providers do not receive adequate reimbursement for the cost of our products by their patients third-party payers', ' Our total revenue could also be adversely affected by changes or trends in reimbursement policies of these governmental or private healthcare payers', ' We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to and will continue to lead to increased pressures on the healthcare industry both foreign and domestic to reduce the cost of products and services', ' Given the efforts to control and reduce healthcare costs in the US in recent years currently available levels of reimbursement may not continue to be available in the future for our existing products or products under development', ' Third-party reimbursement and coverage may not be available or adequate in either the US or foreign markets current reimbursement amounts may be decreased in the future and future legislation regulation or reimbursement

capabilities in a timely manner our total revenue could be adversely affected', ' For example in response to the demand brought on by COVID-19 we have and are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our manufacturing capacity which has placed and may continue to place significant strain on our management personnel operations and systems', ' Failure to increase production volumes in a cost-effective manner lower than anticipated yields or production problems could result in shipment delays as well as increased manufacturing costs which could also have a material adverse effect on our business reputation operating results and financial condition', ' Interruptions in the supply of raw materials components equipment and other products and services could adversely affect our operations and financial results', ' We depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for some of our materials components equipment packaging and other products and services', ' Some of these supplies and services are currently obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers', ' We have long-term supply agreements with many of these suppliers but these long-term agreements involve risks for us such as our potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of quality raw materials equipment or components and our reduced control over pricing quality and timely delivery', ' It is also possible that one or more of these suppliers may become unwilling or unable to deliver supplies or services to us as agreed', ' Unexpected increases in demand for our products or supply shortfalls could require us to obtain additional supplies or services in order to manufacture products to meet the demand', ' Some supplies require significant ordering lead time and we may not be able to timely access sufficient supplies in the event of an unexpected increase in demand or supply shortfall particularly those obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers', ' For example government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected our supply allocation and could in the future result in our inventory materials being requisitioned diverted or allocated by government order such as under emergency disaster and civil defense declarations', ' In addition we use third party packaging companies to ship our products to customers', ' An interruption or delays in the services provided by these third-party packaging companies could also result in a delay of shipments to customers', 'Our business is also subject to risks associated with US and foreign

make use and sell products covered by our patents in any country in which we do not have patent protection', ' We also license the right to use our products to our customers under label licenses that

future performance depends on among other matters if when and at what cost we will receive regulatory approval clearances or authorizations for new products in the US and internationally', ' Regulatory review can be a lengthy expensive and uncertain process making the timing and costs of clearances and approvals difficult to predict', ' Similarly conducting clinical studies that may be required for regulatory approvals or clearances is a complex time-consuming and expensive process requiring months or years to complete and our studies are not guaranteed to generate data that demonstrate safety and effectiveness or substantial equivalence of the evaluated product', ' In addition even after we obtain necessary authorizations clearances or approvals to market our products the FDA and other regulatory agencies may require post-market testing and additional surveillance to monitor the performance and use of approved products or may place conditions on any product approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of those products', ' Our results of operations would be negatively affected by failures or delays in the receipt of regulatory authorizations approvals or clearances changes in laws and regulations the loss of previously received authorizations approvals or clearances or the placement of limits on the manufacture marketing and use of our products', ' For example prior to our acquisition of the Triage Business the Summers Ridge San Diego manufacturing facility was subject to a 2012 FDA inspection that resulted in an FDA warning letter

applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 510k clearances or other premarket submissions were not required', ' We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do not require a new 510k clearance', ' If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 510k notifications we may be required to cease

Developments in Part II Item 7 of this Annual Report if the Combinations are completed Orthos current net debt of $2.1 billion is expected to continue to be outstanding following the closing of the Combinations', ' The degree to which we are leveraged and are subject to deferred and contingent payment obligations could have important or materially adverse consequences to our business and operating results including our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate purposes may be impaired; the payment of our deferred and contingent payment obligations reduces the funds available to us for our operations and other strategic objectives; our debt agreements contain and any agreements to refinance our debt likely will contain financial and other restrictive covenants and our failure to comply with them may result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on us; our level of indebtedness and deferred and contingent payment obligations may increase our vulnerability to and reduce our flexibility to respond to general economic downturns and adverse industry and business conditions;to the extent the debt we incur requires collateral to secure such indebtedness our assets could be at risk and our flexibility related to such assets could be limited; our debt service and deferred and contingent payment obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry; any borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility will be at variable rates of interest which may result in higher interest expense in the event of market interest rates; and any default under our Revolving Credit Facility may result in proceedings against collateral we have used to secure such borrowings including substantially all of our and our guarantor subsidiaries assets', 'Our business could be negatively affected by the loss of or the inability to hire key personnel', ' Our future success depends in part on our ability to retain our key personnel including manufacturing research and development technical sales marketing and executive personnel and our ability to identify and hire additional qualified personnel', ' Competition for these personnel is intense both in the industry in which we operate and where our operations are located', ' Further we expect to grow our operations and our needs for additional management and other key personnel are expected to increase', ' If we fail to retain existing key personnel or timely identify and hire replacement or additional qualified personnel to meet expected growth such failure could adversely impact our business', ' In addition the loss of any of our key personnel particularly key manufacturing research and development and technical personnel could harm our business and prospects and could impede the achievement of our research and development operations or strategic objectives', ' We are subject to and may in the future become subject to claims and litigation that could result in significant expenses and could ultimately

Moreover these lawsuits may divert managements attention from the operation of our business which could adversely affect our business and results of operations', ' Furthermore in the ordinary course of business we must frequently make subjective judgments with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations', ' If regulators disagree with the manner in which we have sought to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subjected to substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as field corrective actions product recalls seizures or injunctions with respect to the sale of our products', ' The assessment of any civil and criminal penalties against us could severely impair our reputation within the industry and affect our operating results and any limitation on our ability to manufacture and market our products could also have a material adverse effect on our business', ' We are exposed to business risk which if not covered by insurance could have an adverse effect on our results of operations', ' We face a number of business risks including exposure to product liability claims', ' Although we maintain insurance for a number of these risks we may face claims for types of damages or for amounts of damages that are not covered by our insurance', ' For example there is a risk that product liability or other claims may exceed the amount of our

adverse effect on our results of operations', 'Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could affect our profitability', ' We are subject to income taxes in the US and in various non-US jurisdictions', ' In addition the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by US federal state and local tax authorities and by non-US tax authorities', ' Due to the potential for changes to tax laws or changes to the interpretation thereof and the ambiguity of tax laws the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our foreign operations and intercompany arrangements and other factors our estimates of income tax assets or liabilities may differ from actual payments assessments or receipts', ' If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected', ' If we determine to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions that have been considered permanently re-invested under existing accounting standards it could also increase our effective tax rate', ' In addition any significant change to the tax system in the US or in other jurisdictions could adversely affect our financial statements', ' Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may

approval', ' Any such issuance could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our business and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders', ' Our amended and restated bylaws include advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that require stockholders to give written notice of any proposal or director nomination to us within a specified period of time prior to any stockholder meeting and do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders unless such stockholders hold at least 50% of our stock entitled to vote at the meeting', ' We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law', ' These provisions may delay deter or prevent a change in control of us adversely affecting the market price of our common stock', ' Expectations of our performance related to ESG matters may impose additional costs on us and expose us to new risks', ' There is an increasing focus from certain investors customers vendors employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility specifically related to ESG factors', ' Many investors may use these factors to guide their investment strategies and in some cases may choose not to invest in us if they believe our ESG performance is inadequate', ' Third-party providers of corporate responsibility ratings and reports have increased in number to meet growing investor demand for measurement of ESG performance', ' The criteria by which our corporate responsibility practices are assessed may change which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria', ' If we elect not to or are unable to satisfy such new criteria investors may conclude that our performance related to corporate responsibility and ESG matters is inadequate', ' Moreover our market capitalization has increased significantly in the last couple of years', ' Accordingly we may be benchmarked against larger peer companies some of which may have more resources than us and thus may have achieved better ESG performance andor a higher ESG rating profile', ' We may face reputational damage if our ESG performance or ESG rating profile is or is perceived as being below those of our competitors or peer companies', ' In addition we could fail or be perceived as failing in our achievement of certain ESG-related

resulting from missed treatments', ' The premiums and fees we charge including premiums dependent upon documented health conditions may not be sufficient to cover the medical and administrative costs associated with COVID-19 and other care services', ' Similarly state and federal mandates for coverage may result in additional incurred expenses that are not associated with increases in government reimbursement such as requirements for insurers to cover at-home COVID-19 testing', 'We have experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for certain services Optum provides to care providers health plans and employers as a result of reduced clinical and claims activity and changes in business priorities resulting from COVID-19. In addition our care delivery business may continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 infections and exposures affecting providers we employ resulting in reduced capacity to handle demand for care

disrupt our business operations or increase our operating costs', ' Additionally the enactment of emergency powers by governments could disrupt our business operations including by restricting pharmaceuticals or other supplies and could increase the risk of shortages of necessary items', ' Although we cannot predict the pacing intensity and duration of COVID-19 the pandemics disruption to business activities employment and economic effects and near and long-term impacts on the patterns of care and services across the healthcare system could continue to have material and adverse effects on our business results of operations financial position or cash flows', ' If we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical costs or set benefit designs in an effective manner the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows', ' Through our risk-based benefit products we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums', ' We generally use approximately 80% to 85% of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers', ' The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical costs', ' Our Optum Health business negotiates value-based arrangements with commercial third-party payers which are also included in premium revenues', ' Under a typical arrangement Optum Health receives a fixed percentage of a third-party payers premiums to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to members', ' Premium revenues from risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues', ' If we fail to predict accurately or effectively price for or manage the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected', 'We manage medical costs through underwriting criteria product design negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs', ' Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered', ' Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences', ' Our revenue on certain Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year', ' Although we base the commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs

technology new treatment guidelines newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics', ' Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results', ' For example if our 2021 medical costs for commercial insured products had been 1% higher than our actual medical costs without proportionally higher revenues from such products our annual net earnings for 2021 would have been reduced by approximately $330 million excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs', ' In addition the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred

certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups and consumers', ' We operate in jurisdictions outside of the United States where contractual rights tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the United States and therefore subject to dispute by customers government authorities or others', ' Any failure by us to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses could subject us to civil and criminal penalties', ' We are largely self-insured with regard to litigation risks including claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us', ' Although we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self-insured matters it is possible the level of actual losses will significantly exceed the liabilities recorded', ' Additionally physicians and other healthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of legal actions alleging medical malpractice and general professional liabilities', ' Even in states that have imposed caps on damages for such actions litigants are seeking recoveries under new theories of liability that might not be subject to the caps on damages', ' Many of these actions involve large claims and significant defense costs and if these actions are asserted against us could result in

and other AARP-branded products and services to Medicare beneficiaries', ' If we fail to meet the needs of our alliance or joint venture partners including by developing additional products and services providing high levels of service pricing our products and services competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory changes our alliances and joint ventures

effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations including our internal control environment and culture or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage', ' In addition even with appropriate diligence pre-acquisition practices of an acquired business may expose us to legal challenges and investigations', ' For example in January 2021 an indictment for alleged violations of antitrust laws was issued by the DOJ against our subsidiary Surgical Care Affiliates SCA based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five years prior to our acquisition', ' We are vigorously defending this lawsuit but if SCA is found liable we may be subject to criminal fines or reputational harm', ' If we cannot successfully integrate these acquisitions and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunities and cost savings our business prospects results of operations

those presented by acquisitions of domestic businesses including challenges in adapting to new markets languages business labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments', ' Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses', ' These challenges vary widely by country and outside of the United States may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions which could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate or converting local currencies we hold into U', 'S', ' dollars or other currencies', ' If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U', 'S', ' acquisitions our business prospects results of operations and financial position could be

Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations', ' Unfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services', ' For example high unemployment during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group benefits and pharmacy services plans', ' Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs', ' In addition unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the

Certain of our Optum businesses are also subject to regulations distinct from those faced by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries some of which could impact our relationships with physicians hospitals and customers', ' These regulations include state telemedicine regulations; debt collection laws; banking regulations; distributor and producer licensing requirements; state corporate practice of medicine doctrines; fee-splitting rules; and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirements', ' These risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our products and services or to do so at targeted operating margins or may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate', ' The laws and rules governing our businesses and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change', ' For example legislative administrative and public policy changes to the ACA have been and likely will continue to be considered and we cannot predict if the ACA will be further modified', ' Litigation challenges have been brought seeking to invalidate the ACA in whole or in part and future litigation challenges are possible', ' Further the integration into our businesses of entities we acquire may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us including by subjecting us to laws and rules which did not previously apply to us', ' The broad latitude given to the agencies administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulations governing our businesses could force us to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements or expose us to increased liability in courts for coverage determinations contract interpretation and other actions', ' We also must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products and services increase prices for certain regulated products and services and complete certain acquisitions and dispositions or integrate certain acquisitions', ' For example premium rates for our health insurance and managed care products are subject to regulatory review or approval in many states and by the federal government', ' Additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increases on many of our products to HHS for monitoring purposes', ' Geographic and product expansions of our businesses may be subject to state and federal regulatory approvals', ' Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate

cross-border data transfers which vary by jurisdiction', ' We currently operate outside of the United States and in the future may acquire or commence additional businesses based outside of the United States increasing our exposure to non-U', 'S', ' regulatory regimes', ' For example our UnitedHealthcare Global business subjects us to Brazilian laws and regulations affecting hospitals managed care and insurance industries and to regulation by Brazilian regulators including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plans the Agência Nacional de Saúde Suplementar while our Banmédica business is subject to Chilean Colombian and Peruvian laws regulations and regulators applicable to hospitals and private insurance', ' Any international regulator may take an approach to

adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets', ' As a result of our participation in various government health care programs both as a payer and as a service provider to payers we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding enrollments payment adjustments audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial position and cash flows', ' We participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit programs including as a payer in Medicare Advantage Medicare Part D various Medicaid programs and CHIP and receive substantial revenues from these programs', ' Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs', ' A reduction or less than expected increase or a protracted delay in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies or termination of the contract at the option of the government may materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows', ' The government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs', ' Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms', ' Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level', ' For example CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible', ' In addition from time to time CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments', ' Although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program', ' In addition payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit', ' States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments', ' Under the Medicaid managed care program state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs', ' If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid plans', ' Under the Medicare Part D program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted', ' If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us', ' In general our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment utilization medical costs and other factors', ' If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids our results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected', ' Many of the government health care coverage programs in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks', ' For example as part of the ACA CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting certain quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level', ' The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS including among others quality of care preventive services chronic illness management handling of appeals and customer satisfaction', ' Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments', ' If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans our membership levels results of operations financial position and cash flows', ' Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs including Medicare and Medicaid or our inability to improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government programs which in turn could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows', 'CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for Medicare programs including adjustment of monthly capitation payments to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Part D plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers for Medicare Advantage plans as well as for Medicare Part D plans risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs', ' Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process', ' For example our UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State businesses submit information relating to the health status of enrollees to CMS or state agencies for purposes of determining the amount of certain payments to us', ' CMS and the Office of Inspector General for HHS periodically perform risk adjustment data validation RADV audits of selected Medicare health plans to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers', ' Certain of our local plans have been selected for such audits which in the past have resulted and in the future could result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to our health plans fines corrective action plans or other adverse action by CMS', ' We have been and in the future may become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments', ' Such investigations audits reviews or assessments sometimes arise out of or prompt claims by private litigants or whistleblowers who among other allegations may claim we failed to disclose certain business practices or as a government contractor submitted false or erroneous claims to the government', ' Governmental investigations audits reviews and assessments could lead to government actions which have resulted in and in the future could result in adverse publicity the assessment of damages civil or criminal fines or penalties or other sanctions including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows', ' Our businesses providing pharmacy care services face regulatory and operational risks and uncertainties which may differ from the risks of our other businesses', ' We provide pharmacy care services through our Optum Rx and UnitedHealthcare businesses', ' Each business is subject to federal and state anti-kickback beneficiary inducement and other laws governing the relationships of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturers physicians pharmacies customers and consumers', ' In addition federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry which could materially affect current industry practices including potential new legislation and regulations regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebates and other fees from pharmaceutical companies the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals limited access to networks and pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies', ' Additionally various governmental agencies have conducted investigations into certain PBM practices which have resulted in other PBMs agreeing to civil penalties including the payment of money and entry into corporate integrity agreements', ' As a provider of pharmacy benefit management services Optum Rx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure registration and other laws and accreditation standards', ' Optum Rx also conducts business through home delivery specialty and compounding pharmacies pharmacies located in community mental health centers and home infusion which subjects it to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those of the DEA and individual state controlled substance authorities the Food and Drug Administration FDA and Boards of Pharmacy', ' We could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our home delivery specialty or compounding or clinic-based pharmacies or the provision of home infusion services including as a result of the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products', ' Disruptions from any of our home delivery specialty pharmacy or home infusion services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows', ' In addition our pharmacy care services businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans subject to ERISA', ' A private party or the DOL which is the agency that enforces ERISA could assert the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pharmacy care services businesses even where those businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations', ' If a court were to determine fiduciary obligations apply we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or claims we entered into certain prohibited transactions', ' If we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data laws regulations and standards including with respect to third-party service providers utilizing protected personal information on our behalf our business reputation results of operations financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected', ' The collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of protected personal information are regulated at the federal state international and industry levels and addressed in requirements imposed on us by contracts with customers', ' These laws rules and requirements are subject to change', ' Compliance with new privacy and security laws regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations', ' Internationally many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply', ' We expect there will continue to be new proposed laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the European Union Brazil Chile India and other jurisdictions and we cannot yet determine the impacts such future laws regulations and standards may have on our businesses or the businesses of our customers', ' For example effective May 2018 the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation GDPR overhauled data protection laws in the European Union', ' GDPR has imposed more stringent European Union data protection requirements on us or our customers and prescribed greater penalties for noncompliance', ' Brazilian privacy legislation similar in certain respects to GDPR took effect in September 2020. Many of our businesses are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard which is a multifaceted security standard designed to protect payment card account data', ' HIPAA requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements', ' While we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third-party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls we have limited oversight or control over their actions and practices', ' Several of our businesses act as business associates to their covered entity customers and as a result collect use disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide services to these customers', ' HHS administers its audit program to assess HIPAA compliance efforts by covered entities and business associates', ' An audit resulting in findings or allegations of noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows', ' Through our Optum businesses we maintain a database of administrative and clinical data statistically de-identified in accordance with HIPAA standards', ' Noncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or requirements or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and among other consequences could subject us to mandatory disclosure to the media loss of existing or new customers significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines penalties and litigation awards', ' Any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows', ' Restrictions on our ability to obtain funds from our regulated subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows', ' Because we operate as
